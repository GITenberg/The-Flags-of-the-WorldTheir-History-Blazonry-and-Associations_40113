  <p>So soon as man passes from the lowest stage of barbarism the necessity
  for some special sign, distinguishing man from man, tribe from tribe,
  nation from nation, makes itself felt; and this prime necessity once met,
  around the symbol chosen spirit-stirring memories quickly gather that
  endear it, and make it the emblem of the power and dignity of those by
  whom it is borne. The painted semblance of grizzly bear, or beaver, or
  rattlesnake on the canvas walls of the tepi of the prairie Brave, the
  special chequering of colours that compose the tartan<a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> of the Highland clansman, are examples of
  this; and as we pass from individual or local tribe to mighty nations,
  the same influence is still at work, and the distinctive Union Flag of
  Britain, the tricolor of France, the gold and scarlet bars of the flag of
  Spain, all alike appeal with irresistible force to the patriotism of
  those born beneath their folds, and speak to them of the glories and
  greatness of the historic past, the duties of the present, and the hopes
  of the future&mdash;inspiring those who gaze upon their proud blazonry
  with the determination to be no unworthy sons of their fathers, but to
  live, and if need be to die, for the dear home-land of which these are
  the symbol. <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum" title="013.png"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span></p>

  <p>The standards used by the nations of antiquity differed in nature from
  the flags that in mediæval and modern days have taken their place. These
  earlier symbols were ordinary devices wrought in metal, and carried at
  the head of poles or spears. Thus the hosts of Egypt marched to war
  beneath the shadow of the various sacred animals that typified their
  deities, or the fan-like arrangement of feathers that symbolised the
  majesty of Pharoah, while the Assyrian standards, to be readily seen
  represented on the slabs from the palaces of Khorsabad and Kyonjik, in
  the British Museum and elsewhere, were circular disks of metal containing
  various distinctive devices. Both these and the Egyptian standards often
  have in addition a small flag-like streamer attached to the staff
  immediately below the device. The Greeks in like manner employed the Owl
  of Athene, and such-like religious and patriotic symbols of the
  protection of the deities, though Homer, it will be remembered, makes
  Agamemnon use a piece of purple cloth as a rallying point for his
  followers. The sculptures of Persepolis show us that the Persians adopted
  the figure of the Sun, the eagle, and the like. In Rome a hand erect, or
  the figures of the horse, wolf, and other animals were used, but at a
  later period the eagle alone was employed. Pliny tells us that "Caius
  Marius in his second consulship ordained that the Roman legions should
  only have the Eagle for their standard. For before that time the Eagle
  marched foremost with four others, wolves, minatours, horses, and
  bears&mdash;each one in its proper order. Not many years past the Eagle
  alone began to be advanced in battle, and the rest were left behind in
  the camp. But Marius rejected them altogether, and since this it is
  observed that scarcely is there a camp of a Legion wintered at any time
  without having a pair of Eagles." The eagle, we need scarcely stay to
  point out, obtained this pre-eminence as being the bird of Jove. The
  Vexillum, or cavalry flag, was, according to Livy, a square piece of
  cloth fixed to a cross bar at the end of a spear; this was often richly
  fringed, and was either plain or bore certain devices upon it, and was
  strictly and properly a flag. The ensigns which distinguished the allied
  forces from the legions of the Romans were also of this character.
  Examples of these vexilla may be seen on the sculptured columns of Trajan
  and Antoninus, the arch of Titus, and upon various coins and medals of
  ancient Rome.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Standard or Labarum carried before Constantine and his
  successors resembled the cavalry Vexillum.<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> It was of purple silk, richly embroidered
  with gold, and though ordinarily <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum" title="014.png"
  ><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>suspended from a horizontal cross-bar, was
  occasionally displayed in accordance with our modern usage by attachment
  by one of its sides to the staff.</p>

  <p>The Roman standards were guarded with religious veneration in the
  temples of the metropolis and of the chief cities of the Empire, and
  modern practice has followed herein the ancient precedent. As in classic
  days the protection of Jove was invoked, so in later days the blessing of
  Jehovah, the Lord of Hosts, has been sought. At the presentation of
  colours to a regiment a solemn service of prayer and praise is held, and
  when these colours return in honour, shot-rent from victorious conflict,
  they are reverently placed in stately abbey, venerable cathedral, or
  parish church, never more to issue from the peace and rest of the home of
  God until by lapse of years they crumble into indistinguishable dust.</p>

  <p>The Israelites carried the sacred standard of the Maccabees, with the
  initial letters of the Hebrew text, "Who is like unto Thee, O God,
  amongst the gods?" The Emperor Constantine caused the sacred monogram of
  Christ to be placed on the Labarum, and when the armies of Christendom
  went forth to rescue the Holy Land from the infidel they received their
  cross-embroidered standards from the foot of the altar. Pope Alexander
  II. sent a consecrated white banner to Duke William previous to his
  expedition against Harold, and we read in the "Beehive of the Romish
  Church," published in 1580, how "the Spaniardes christen, conjure, and
  hallow their Ensignes, naming one Barbara, another Katherine," after the
  names of saints whose aid they invoked in the stress of battle. We may
  see this invocation again very well in Figs. <a href="#fig147">147</a>,
  <a href="#fig148">148</a>: flags borne by the colonists of Massachusetts
  when they arrayed themselves against the mercenaries of King George, and
  appealed to the God of Battles in behalf of the freedom and justice
  denied by those who bore rule over them.</p>

  <p>This recognition of the King of kings has led also to the captured
  banners of the enemy being solemnly suspended in gratitude and
  thanksgiving in the house of God. Thus Speed tells us that on the
  dispersal and defeat of the Armada, Queen Elizabeth commanded solemn
  thanksgiving to be celebrated at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul's, in
  her chief city of London, which accordingly was done upon Sunday, the 8th
  of September, when eleven of the Spanish ensigns were hung, to the great
  joy of the beholders, as "psalmes of praise" for England's deliverance
  from sore peril. Very appropriately, too, in the Chapel of the Royal
  College at Chelsea, the home of the old soldiers who helped to win them,
  hang the flags taken at Barrosa, Martinique, Bhurtpore, Seringapatam,
  Salamanca, Waterloo, and many another hard-fought struggle; <!-- Page 4
  --><span class="pagenum" title="015.png"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>and thus, in like manner, is the tomb of
  Napoleon I., in Paris, surrounded by trophies of captured flags. On March
  30th, 1814, the evening before the entry of the Allies into Paris, about
  1,500 flags&mdash;the victorious trophies of Napoleon&mdash;were burnt in
  the Court of the Eglise des Invalides, to prevent their falling into the
  hands of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Early flags were almost purely of a religious character.<a
  name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The first notice of banners
  in England is in Bede's description of the interview between the heathen
  King Ethelbert and Augustine, the missionary from Rome, where the
  followers of the latter are described as bearing banners on which were
  displayed silver crosses; and we need scarcely pause to point out that in
  Roman Catholic countries, where the ritual is emotional and sensuous,
  banners of this type are still largely employed to add to the pomp of
  religious processions. Heraldic and political devices upon flags are of
  later date, and even when these came freely into use their presence did
  not supplant the ecclesiastical symbols. The national banner of England
  for centuries&mdash;the ruddy cross of her patron Saint George (Fig. <a
  href="#fig91">91</a>)&mdash;was a religious one, and, whatever other
  banners were carried, this was ever foremost in the field. The Royal
  banner of Great Britain and Ireland that we see in Fig. <a
  href="#fig44">44</a>, in its rich blazonry of the lions of England and
  Scotland and the Irish harp, is a good example of the heraldic flag,
  while our Union flag (Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>), equally symbolizes
  the three nations of the United Kingdom, but this time by the allied
  crosses of the three patron saints, St. George, St. Andrew, and St.
  Patrick, and it is therefore a lineal descendant and exemplar of the
  religious influence that was once all-powerful.</p>

  <p>The ecclesiastical flags were often purely pictorial in character,
  being actual representations of the Persons of the Trinity, of the Virgin
  Mother, or of divers saints. At other times the monasteries and other
  religious houses bore banners of heraldic character; as the leading
  ecclesiastics were both lords temporal and lords spiritual, taking their
  places in the ranks of fighting men and leading on the field the body of
  dependants and retainers that they were required to maintain in aid of
  the national defence. In such case <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum" title="016.png"
  ><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>the distinguishing banner of the
  contingent conformed in character to the heraldic cognisances of the
  other nobles in the host. Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>, for instance, was
  the banner of St. Alban's Abbey. In a poem on the capture of Rouen by the
  English, in the year 1418, written by an eye-witness of the scenes
  described, we read how the English commander&mdash;</p>

  <p>Henry V., at Agincourt, in like manner displayed at his headquarters
  on the field not only his own arms, but, in place of special honour and
  prominence, the banners of the Trinity, of St. George, and of St. Edward.
  These banners of religious significance were often borne from the
  monasteries to the field of battle, while monks and priests in attendance
  on them invoked the aid of Heaven during the strife. In an old statement
  of accounts, still existing, we read that Edward I. made a payment of
  8½d. a day to a priest of Beverley for carrying throughout one of his
  campaigns a banner bearing the figure of St. John. St. Wilfred's banner
  from Ripon, together with this banner of St. John from Beverley, were
  brought on to the field at Northallerton; the flag of St. Denis was
  carried in the armies of St. Louis and of Philip le Bel, and the banner
  of St. Cuthbert of Durham was borrowed by the Earl of Surrey in his
  expedition against Scotland in the reign of Henry VIII. This banner had
  the valuable reputation of securing victory to those who fought under it.
  It was suspended from a horizontal bar below a spear head, and was a yard
  or so in breadth and a little more than this in depth; the bottom edge
  had five deep indentations. The banner was of red velvet sumptuously
  enriched with gold embroidery, and in the centre was a piece of white
  velvet, half a yard square, having a cross of red velvet upon it. This
  central portion covered and protected a relic of the saint. The victory
  of Neville's Cross, October 17th, 1346, was held to be largely <!-- Page
  6 --><span class="pagenum" title="017.png"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>due to the presence of this sacred banner, and
  the triumph at Flodden was also ascribed to it.</p>

  <p>During the prevalence of Roman Catholicism in England, we find that
  banners of religious type entered largely into the funeral obsequies of
  persons of distinction: thus at the burial of Arthur, Prince of Wales,
  the eldest son of Henry VII., we find a banner of the Trinity, another
  with the cross and instruments of the Passion depicted upon it; another
  of the Virgin Mary, and yet another with a representation of St. George.
  Such banners, as in the present instance, were ordinarily four in number,
  and carried immediately round the body at the four corners of the bier.
  Thus we read in the diary of an old chronicler, Machyn, who lived in the
  reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, that at the burial of the
  Countess of Arundel, October 27th, 1557, "cam iiij herroldes in ther
  cotes of armes, and bare iiij baners of emages at the iiij corners."
  Again, on "Aprell xxix, 1554, was bered my Lady Dudley in Saint Margarett
  in Westminster, with iiij baners of emages." Another item deals with the
  funeral of the Duchess of Northumberland, and here again "the iiij baners
  of ymages" again recur. Anyone having the old records, church
  inventories, and the like before them, would find it easy enough, as easy
  as needless, to multiply illustrations of this funeral use of pictured
  banners. These "emages" or "ymages" of old Machyn are of course not
  images in the sense of sculptured or carved things, but are painted and
  embroidered representations of various saints. Machyn, as a greatly
  interested looker-on at all the spectacles of his day, is most
  entertaining, but his spelling, according to the severer notions of the
  present day, is a little weak, as, for instance, in the following words
  that we have culled at random from his pages:&mdash;prossessyon,
  gaffelyns, fezyssyoun, dysquyet, neckclygens, gorgyusle, berehyng, wypyd,
  pelere, artelere, and dyssys of spyssys. The context ordinarily makes the
  meaning clear, but as our readers have not that advantage, we give the
  same words according to modern orthography&mdash;procession, javelins,
  physician, disquiet, negligence, gorgeously, burying, whipped, pillory,
  artillery, dishes of spices.</p>

  <p>The various companies and guilds of the mediæval period had their
  special flags that came out, as do those of their successors of the
  present day, on the various occasions of civic pageantry; and in many
  cases, as may be seen in the illuminated MSS. in the British Museum and
  elsewhere, they were carried to battle as the insignia of the companies
  of men provided at the expense of those corporations. Thus in one example
  that has come under our notice we see a banner bearing a chevron between
  hammer, trowels, and builder's square; in another between an axe and two
  pairs of compasses, while a third on its azure field bears a pair of
  golden <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum" title="018.png"><a
  name="page7"></a>{7}</span>shears. In the representation of a battle
  between Philip d'Artevelde and the Flemings against the French, many of
  the flags therein introduced bear the most extraordinary devices, boots
  and shoes, drinking-vessels, anvils, and the like, that owe their
  presence there to the fact that various trade guilds sent their
  contingents of men to the fight. In a French work on mediæval guilds we
  find the candle-makers of Bayeux marching beneath a black banner with
  three white candles on it, the locksmiths of La Rochelle having a scarlet
  flag with four golden keys on it. The lawyers of Loudoun had a flag with
  a large eye on it (a single eye to business being, we presume,
  understood), while those of Laval had a blue banner with three golden
  mouths thereon. In like manner the metal-workers of Laval carried a black
  flag with a silver hammer and files depicted on it, those of Niort had a
  red flag with a silver cup and a fork and spoon in gold on either side.
  The metal-workers of Ypres also carried a red flag, and on this was
  represented a golden flagon and two buckles of gold. Should some national
  stress this year or next lead our City Companies, the Fishmongers, the
  Carpenters, the Vintners, and others to contribute contingents to the
  defence of the country, and to send them forth beneath the banners of the
  guilds, history would but repeat itself.</p>

  <p>In matters political the two great opposing parties have their
  distinctive colours, and these have ordinarily been buff and blue, though
  the association of buff with the Liberal party and "true blue" with the
  Conservatives has been by no means so entirely a matter of course as
  persons who have not looked into the matter might be disposed to imagine.
  The local colours are often those that were once the livery colours of
  the principal family in the district, and were assumed by its adherents
  for the family's sake quite independently of its political creed. The
  notion of livery is now an unpleasant one, but in mediæval days the
  colours of the great houses were worn by the whole country-side, and the
  wearing carried with it no suggestion either of toadyism or servitude. As
  this influence was hereditary and at one time all-powerful, the colour of
  the Castle, or Abbey, or Great House, became stereotyped in that district
  as the symbol of the party of which these princely establishments were
  the local centre and visible evidence, and the colour still often
  survives locally, though the political and social system that originated
  it has passed away in these days of democratic independence.</p>

  <p>It would clearly be a great political gain if one colour were all over
  Great Britain the definite emblem of one side, as many illiterate voters
  are greatly influenced by the colours worn by the candidates for their
  suffrages, and have sufficient sense of consistency of principle to vote
  always for the flag that first claimed <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="019.png"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>their
  allegiance, though it may very possibly be that if they move to another
  county it is the emblem of a totally distinct party, and typifies
  opinions to which the voter has always been opposed. At a late election a
  Yorkshire Conservative, who had acquired a vote for Bournemouth, was told
  that he must "vote pink," but this he very steadily refused to do. He
  declared that he would "never vote owt else but th' old true blue," so
  the Liberal party secured his vote; and this sort of thing at a General
  Election is going on all over the country. The town of Royston, for
  instance, stands partly in Hertfordshire and partly in Cambridgeshire,
  and in the former county the Conservatives and in the latter the Liberals
  are the blue party; hence the significance of the colour in one street of
  the little town is entirely different to that it bears in another. At
  Horsham in Sussex we have observed that the Conservative colour is pale
  pink, while in Richmond in Surrey it is a deep orange. The orange was
  adopted by the Whigs out of compliment to William III., who was Prince of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>In the old chronicles and ballads reference is made to many forms of
  flags now obsolete. The term flag is a generic one, and covers all the
  specific kinds. It is suggested that the word is derived from the
  Anglo-Saxon verb fleogan, to fly or float in the wind, or from the old
  German flackern, to flutter. Ensign is an alternative word formed on the
  idea of the display of insignia, badges, or devices, and was formerly
  much used where we should now employ the word colours. The company
  officers in a regiment who were until late years termed ensigns were at a
  still earlier period more correctly termed ensign-bearers. Milton, it
  will be recalled, describes a "Bannered host under spread ensigns
  marching." Sir Walter Scott greatly enlarges our vocabulary when he
  writes in "Marmion" of where</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A thousand streamers flaunted fair,</p>
      <p>Various in shape, device, and hue,</p>
      <p>Green, sanguine, purple, red, and blue,</p>
      <p>Broad, narrow, swallow-tailed, and square,</p>
      <p>Scroll, pennon, pensil, bandrol, there</p>
      <p>O'er the pavilions flew,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>while Milton again writes of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced</p>
      <p>Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear</p>
      <p>Stream in the air, and for distinction serve</p>
      <p>Of hierarchies, orders, and degrees."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We have seen that the pomp of funeral display led to the use of
  pictorial flags of religious type, and with these were associated others
  that dealt with the mundane rank and position of the <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="020.png"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>deceased.
  Thus we find Edmonson, in his book on Heraldry, writing as
  follows:&mdash;"The armorial ensigns, as fixed by the officers of arms,
  and through long and continued usage established as proper to be carried
  in funeral processions, are pennons, guidons, cornets, standards,
  banners, and banner-rolls, having thereon depicted the arms, quarterings,
  badges, crests, supporters, and devices of the defunct: together with all
  such other trophies of honour as in his lifetime he was entitled to
  display, carry, or wear in the field; banners charged with the armorial
  ensigns of such dignities, titles, offices, civil and military, as were
  possessed or enjoyed by the defunct at the time of his decease, and
  banner-rolls of his own matches and lineal descent both on the paternal
  and maternal side. In case the defunct was an Archbishop, banner-rolls of
  the arms and insignia of the sees to which he had been elected and
  translated, and if he was a merchant or eminent trader pennons of the
  particular city, corporation, guild, fraternity, craft, or company
  whereof he had been a member." However true the beautiful stanza of
  Gray&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,</p>
      <p class="i2">And all that beauty, all that wealth ere gave,</p>
      <p>Await at last the inevitable hour,</p>
      <p class="i2">The paths of glory lead but to the grave"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the survivors of the deceased most naturally and most justly bore to
  their rest those to whom honour was due with the full respect to which
  their career on earth entitled them.</p>

  <p>The names bestowed upon the different kinds of flags have varied from
  time to time, the various authorities of mediæval and modern days not
  being quite of one mind sometimes, so that while the more salient forms
  are easily identifiable, some little element of doubt creeps in when we
  would endeavour to bestow with absolute precision a name to a certain
  less common form before us, or a definite form to a name that we
  encounter in some old writer. Whatever looseness of nomenclature,
  however, may be encountered on the fringe of our subject, the bestowal of
  the leading terms is sufficiently definite, and it is to these we now
  turn our attention, reflecting for our comfort that it is of far greater
  value to us to know all about a form that is of frequent recurrence, and
  to which abundant reference is made, than to be able to quite
  satisfactorily decide what special name some abnormal form should carry,
  or what special form is meant by a name that perhaps only occurs once or
  twice in the whole range of literature, and even that perhaps by some
  poet or romance writer who has thought more of the general effect of his
  description than of the technical accuracy of the terms in which he has
  clothed it. <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum" title="021.png"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span></p>

  <p>The Banner first engages our attention. This was ordinarily, in the
  earlier days of chivalry, a square flag, though in later examples it may
  be found somewhat greater in length than in depth, and in some early
  examples it is considerably greater in depth than in its degree of
  projection outwards from the lance. In the technical language of the
  subject, the part of a flag nearest the pole is called the hoist, and the
  outer part the fly. Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> is a good illustration
  of this elongated form. It has been suggested that the shortness of the
  fly in such cases was in order that the greater fluttering in the wind
  that such a form as Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a> would produce might be
  prevented, as this constant tugging at the lance-head would be
  disagreeable to the holder, while it might, in the rush of the charge,
  prevent that accuracy of aim that one would desire to give one's
  adversary the full benefit of at such a crisis in his career. Pretty as
  this may be as a theory, there is probably not much in it, or the form in
  those warlike days of chivalry would have been more generally adopted.
  According to an ancient authority the banner of an emperor should be six
  feet square; of a king, five; of a prince or duke, four; and of an earl,
  marquis, viscount, or baron three feet square. When we consider that the
  great function of the banner was to bear upon its surface the
  coat-of-arms of its owner, and that this coat was emblazoned upon it and
  filled up its entire surface in just the same way that we find these
  charges represented upon his shield, it is evident that no form that
  departed far either in length or breadth from the square would be
  suitable for their display. Though heraldically it is allowable to
  compress or extend any form from its normal proportions when the
  exigencies of space demand it,<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> it is clearly better to escape this when
  possible.<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The arms
  depicted in Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a> are certainly not the better for
  the elongation to which they have been subjected, while <i>per contra</i>
  the bearings on any of the banners in Figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, <a
  href="#fig2">2</a>, <a href="#fig3">3</a>, <a href="#fig4">4</a>, <a
  href="#fig5">5</a>, <a href="#fig6">6</a>, <a href="#fig7">7</a>, <a
  href="#fig8">8</a>, <a href="#fig9">9</a>, <a href="#fig10">10</a>, or <a
  href="#fig11">11</a>, have had no despite done them, the square form
  being clearly well-adapted for their due display.</p>

  <p>The Rolls of Arms prepared on various occasions by the mediæval and
  later heralds form an admirable storehouse of examples. Some of these
  have been reproduced in facsimile, and are, therefore, more or less
  readily accessible. We have before us as we write the roll of the arms of
  the Sovereign and of the <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum" title="022.png"
  ><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>spiritual and temporal peers who sat in
  Parliament in the year 1515, and another excellent example that has been
  reproduced is the roll of Karlaverok. This Karlaverok was a fortress on
  the north side of Solway Frith, which it was necessary for Edward I. to
  reduce on his invasion of Scotland in the year 1300, and this investiture
  and all the details of the siege are minutely described by a contemporary
  writer, who gives the arms and names of all the nobles there engaged. As
  soon as the castle fell into Edward's hands he caused his banner and that
  of St. Edmund (Fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>), and St. Edward (Fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>), to be displayed upon its battlements. The roll is
  written in Norman French, of which the following passage may be given as
  an example<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"La ont meinte riche garnement</p>
      <p>Brode sur cendeaus et samis</p>
      <p>Meint beau penon en lance mis</p>
      <p>Meint baniere desploie."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That is to say, there were&mdash;in modern English wording&mdash;many
  rich devices embroidered on silk and satin, many a beautiful pennon fixed
  on lance, many a banner displayed. The writer says:&mdash;"First, I will
  tell you of the names and arms, especially of the banners, if you will
  listen how." Of these numerous banners we give some few examples: Fig. <a
  href="#fig1">1</a> belongs to him "who with a light heart, doing good to
  all, bore a yellow banner and pennon with a black saltire engrailed, and
  is called John Botetourte." Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a> is the banner of
  Sire Ralph de Monthermer; Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a> the devices of
  Touches, "a knight of good-fame"; while Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>, "the
  blue with crescents of brilliant gold," was the flag of William de Ridre.
  "Sire John de Holderton, who at all times appears well and promptly in
  arms," bore No. 6, the fretted silver on the scarlet field; while Fig. <a
  href="#fig5">5</a> is the cognisance of "Hugh Bardolph, a man of good
  appearance, rich, valiant, and courteous." Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a> is
  the well-known lion of the Percys, and is here the banner of Henri de
  Percy; we meet with it again in Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>. Fig. <a
  href="#fig8">8</a> is "the banner of good Hugh de Courtenay," while Fig.
  <a href="#fig9">9</a> is that of the valiant Aymer de Valence. Fig. <a
  href="#fig10">10</a> bears the barbels of John de Bar, while the last
  example we need give (Fig. <a href="#fig11">11</a>) is the banner of Sire
  William de Grandison. Of whom gallant, courteous Englishmen as they were,
  we can now but say that "they are dust, their swords are rust," and deny
  them not the pious hope "their souls are with the saints, we trust."</p>

  <p>The well-known flag (Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>), that everyone
  recognises as the Royal Standard, is nevertheless misnamed, as it should
  undoubtedly be called the Royal Banner, since it bears the arms of the
  Sovereign in precisely the same way that any of our preceding <!-- Page
  12 --><span class="pagenum" title="023.png"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>examples bear the arms of the knights with
  whom they were associated. A standard, as we shall see presently, is an
  entirely different kind of flag; nevertheless, the term Royal Standard is
  so firmly established that it is hopeless now to think of altering it,
  and as it would be but pedantry to ignore it, and substitute in its
  place, whenever we have occasion to refer to it, its proper
  title&mdash;the Royal Banner&mdash;we must, having once made our protest,
  be content to let the matter stand. Figs. <a href="#fig22">22</a>, <a
  href="#fig43">43</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>, <a href="#fig194">194</a>,
  <a href="#fig226">226</a>, and <a href="#fig245">245</a> are all royal or
  imperial banners, but popular usage insists that we shall call them royal
  or imperial "standards," so, henceforth, rightly or wrongly, through our
  pages standards they must be.</p>

  <p>The banners of the Knights of the Garter, richly emblazoned with their
  armorial bearings, are suspended over their stalls in St. George's
  Chapel, Windsor, while those of the Knights of the Bath are similarly
  displayed in the Chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p>The whole of the great mainsail of a mediæval ship was often
  emblazoned with arms, and formed one large banner. This usage may be very
  well seen in the illuminations, seals, etc., of that period. As early as
  the year 1247 we find Otho, Count of Gueldres, represented as bearing on
  his seal a square banner charged with his arms, a lion rampant; and in a
  window in the Cathedral of Our Lady, at Chartres, is a figure of Simon de
  Montfort, Earl of Leicester from 1236 to 1265. He is depicted as bearing
  in his right hand a banner of red and white, as shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig18">18</a>.</p>

  <p>References in the old writers to the banner are very numerous. Thus in
  the "Story of Thebes" we read of "the fell beastes," that were "wrought
  and bete upon their bannres displaied brode" when men went forth to war.

  <p>An interesting reference is found in a letter of Queen Katharine of
  Arragon to Thomas Wolsey, dated Richmond, August 13th, 1513, while King
  Henry VIII. was in France. Speaking of war with the Scots, her Majesty
  says: "My hert is veray good to it, and I am horrible besy with making
  standards, banners, and bagies."<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>While the men are buckling on their armour for the coming strife,
  wives, sisters, sweethearts, daughters, with proud hearts, give their
  aid, and with busy fingers&mdash;despite the tear that will sometimes
  blur the vision of the gay embroidery&mdash;swiftly and deftly labour
  with loving care on the devices that will nerve the warriors to living
  steel in the shock of battle. The Queen of England, so zealously busy in
  her task of love, is but a type and exemplar of thousands of her sex
  before and since. The raven standard of the Danish invaders of
  Northumbria was worked by the daughters of Regnar Lodbrok, and in the
  great rebellion in the West of England many a gentlewoman suffered sorely
  in the foul and Bloody Assize for her zealous share in providing the
  insurgents with the standards around which they rallied. The Covenanters
  of Scotland, the soldiers of Garibaldi freeing Italy from the Bourbons,
  the levies of Kossuth in Hungary, the Poles in the deadly grip of Russia,
  the armies of the Confederate States in America, the Volunteers who would
  fain free Greece from the yoke of the Turk,<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> all fought to the death beneath the
  banners that fair sympathisers with them, and with their cause, placed in
  their hands. When two great nations, such as France and Germany, fall to
  blows, the whole armament, weapons, flags, and whatever else may be
  necessary, is supplied from the government stores according to regulation
  pattern, but in the case of insurgents against authority
  struggling&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;to be free, the weapons may be
  scythe blades or whatever else comes first to hand, while the standards
  borne to the field will bear the most extraordinary devices upon them,
  devices that appeal powerfully at the time to those fighting beneath
  their folds, but which give a shudder to the purist in heraldic blazonry,
  as for instance, to quote but one example, the rattle-snake flag with its
  motto "Beware how you tread on me," adopted by the North American
  colonists in their struggle against the troops of George III.</p>

  <p>When a knight had performed on the field of battle some especially
  valiant or meritorious act, it was open to the Sovereign to <!-- Page 14
  --><span class="pagenum" title="025.png"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>mark his sense of it by making him a
  knight-banneret. Thus, in the reign of Edward III., John de Copeland was
  made a banneret for his service in taking prisoner David Bruce, the King
  of Scotland, at the battle of Durham; Colonel John Smith, having rescued
  the royal banner from the Parliamentarians at Edgehill, was in like
  manner made a knight-banneret by Charles I. The title does not seem to
  have been in existence before the reign of Edward I., and after this
  bestowal by Charles I. we hear no more of it till 1743, when the title
  was conferred upon several English officers by the king, George II., upon
  the field of Dettingen. It was an essential condition that the rank
  should be bestowed by the Sovereign on the actual field of battle and
  beneath the royal banner. General Sir William Erskine was given this rank
  by George III. on his return from the Continent in 1764, after the battle
  of Emsdorff; but as the investiture took place beneath the standard of
  the 15th Light Dragoons and in Hyde Park, it was deemed hopelessly
  irregular, and, the royal will and action notwithstanding, his rank was
  not generally recognised.</p>

  <p>The ceremony of investiture was in the earlier days a very simple one.
  The flag of the ordinary knight was of the form known as the
  pennon&mdash;a small, swallow-tailed flag like that borne by our lancer
  regiments, of which Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a> is an illustration. On
  being summoned to the royal presence, the king took from him his lance,
  and either cut or tore away the points of his flag, until he had reduced
  it roughly to banner form, and then returned it to him with such words of
  commendation as the occasion called for. What the ceremony employed at so
  late a period as Dettingen was we have not been able to trace. As the
  officers there honoured were lanceless and pennonless, it is evident that
  the formula which served in the Middle Ages was quite inapplicable, but
  it is equally evident that in the thronging duties and responsibilities
  of the field of battle the ceremony must always have been a very short
  and simple one.</p>

  <p>The term Standard is appropriately applied to any flag of noble size
  that answers in the main to the following conditions&mdash;that it should
  always have the Cross of St. George placed next to the staff, that the
  rest of the flag should be divided horizontally into two or more stripes
  of colours, these being the prevailing colours in the arms of the bearers
  or their livery colours, the edge of the standard richly fringed or
  bordered, the motto and badges of the owner introduced, the length
  considerably in excess of the breadth, the ends split and rounded off. We
  find such standards in use chiefly during the fifteenth century, though
  some characteristic examples of both earlier and later dates may be
  encountered. Figs. <a href="#fig14">14</a> and <a href="#fig15">15</a>
  are very good typical illustrations. The <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="026.png"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>first of
  these (Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>) is the Percy standard. The blue
  lion, the crescent, and the fetterlock there seen are all badges of the
  family, while the silver key betokens matrimonial alliance with the
  Poynings,<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> the bugle-horn
  with the Bryans,<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and the
  falchion with the family of Fitzpayne. The ancient badge of the Percys
  was the white lion statant. Our readers will doubtless be familiar with
  the lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Who, in field or foray slack,</p>
      <p>Saw the blanch lion e'er give back?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>but Henry Percy, the fifth earl, 1489 to 1577, turned it into a blue
  one. The silver crescent is the only badge of the family that has
  remained in active and continuous use, and we find frequent references to
  it in the old ballads&mdash;so full of interesting heraldic
  allusions&mdash;as, for instance, in "The Rising of the North"&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Erle Percy there his ancyent spred,</p>
      <p>The halfe-moon shining all soe faire,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and in Claxton's "Lament"&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now the Percy's crescent is set in blood."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The motto is ordinarily a very important part of the standard, though
  it is occasionally missing. Its less or greater length or its possible
  repetition may cut up the surface of the flag into a varying number of
  spaces. The first space after the cross is always occupied by the most
  important badge, and in a few cases the spaces beyond are empty.</p>

  <p>The motto of the Percys is of great historic interest. It is referred
  to by Shakespeare, "Now Esperance! Percy! and set on," and we find in
  Drayton the line, "As still the people cried, A Percy, Esperance!" In the
  "Mirror for Magistrates" (1574) we read, "Add therefore this to
  Esperance, my word, who causeth bloodshed shall not 'scape the sword." It
  was originally the war-cry of the Percys, but it has undergone several
  modifications, and these of a rather curious and interesting nature,
  since we see in the sequence a steady advance from blatant egotism to an
  admission of a higher power even than that of Percy. The war-cry of the
  first Earl was originally, "Percy! Percy!" but he later substituted for
  it, "Esperance, Percy." The second and third Earls took merely
  "Esperance," the fourth took "Esperance, ma comfort," and, <!-- Page 16
  --><span class="pagenum" title="027.png"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>later on, "Esperance en Dieu ma comfort,"
  and the fifth and succeeding Earls took the "Esperance en Dieu."<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig15">15</a> is the standard of Sir Thomas de
  Swynnerton. The swine is an example of the punning allusion to the
  bearer's name that is so often seen in the charges of mediæval
  heraldry.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#fig14">14</a> and <a href="#fig15">15</a> are typical
  standards, having the cross of St. George, the striping of colours, the
  oblique lines of motto, the elongated tapering form, and all the other
  features that we have already quoted as belonging to the ideal standard,
  though one or two of these may at times be absent. Thus, though
  exceptions are rare, a standard is not necessarily particoloured for
  example, and, as we have seen, the motto in other examples may be
  missing. The Harleian MS. No. 2,358 lays down the rule that "every
  Standard or guydhome is to hang in the Chiefe the Crosse of St. George,
  to be slitte at the ende, and to conteyne the crest or supporter, with
  the poesy, worde, and devise of the owner." That the Cross of St. George,
  the national badge, must always be present and in the most honourable
  position is full of significance, as it means that whatever else of rank
  or family the bearer might be, he was first and foremost an
  Englishman.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#fig13">13</a> and <a href="#fig16">16</a> are
  interesting modern examples of the Standard. They are from a series of
  sledge-flags used during the Arctic Expedition of 1875-6, the devices
  upon them being those of the officers in charge of each detachment.</p>

  <p>When in earlier days a man raised a regiment for national defence, he
  not only commanded it, but its flag often bore his arms or device. Thus
  the standard of the dragoons raised by Henry, Lord Cardross, in 1689 was
  of red silk, on which was represented the Colonel's crest, a hand holding
  a dagger, and the motto "Fortitudine," while in the upper corner next the
  staff was the thistle of Scotland, surmounted by the crown.</p>

  <p>Our readers should now have no difficulty in sketching out for
  themselves as an exercise the following: The standard of Henry V., white
  and blue, a white antelope standing between four red roses; the motto
  "Dieu et mon droit," and in the interspaces more red <!-- Page 17
  --><span class="pagenum" title="028.png"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>roses. The standard of Richard II., white
  and green, a white hart couchant between four golden suns, the motto
  "Dieu et mon droit," in the next space two golden suns, and in the next,
  four. As further exercises, we may give the standard of Sir John Awdeley,
  of gold and scarlet, having a Moor's head and three white butterflies,
  the motto "Je le tiens," then two butterflies, then four; and the
  standard of Frogmorton, of four stripes of red and white, having an
  elephant's head in black, surrounded by golden crescents. While no one,
  either monarch or noble, could have more than one banner, since this was
  composed of his heraldic arms, a thing fixed and unchangeable, the same
  individual might have two or three standards, since these were mainly
  made up of badges that he could multiply at discretion, and a motto or
  poesy that he might change every day if he chose. Hence, for instance,
  the standards of Henry VII. were mostly green and white, since these were
  the Tudor livery colours; but in one was "a red firye dragon," and in
  another "was peinted a donne kowe," while yet another had a silver
  greyhound between red roses. Stowe and other authorities tell us that the
  two first of these were borne at Bosworth Field, and that after his
  victory there over Richard III. these were borne by him in solemn state
  to St. Paul's Cathedral, and there deposited on his triumphal entry into
  the metropolis.</p>

  <p>The difference between the standard and the banner is very clearly
  seen in the description of the flags borne at the funeral obsequies of
  Queen Elizabeth&mdash;"the great embroidered banner of England" (Fig. <a
  href="#fig22">22</a>), the banners of Wales, Ireland, Chester, and
  Cornwall, and the standards of the dragon, greyhound, and falcon. In like
  manner Stowe tells us that when King Henry VII. took the field in 1513,
  he had with him the standard with the red dragon and the banner of the
  arms of England, and Machyn tells that at the funeral of Edward VI.,
  "furst of all whent a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples and
  clarkes syngyng and then ij harolds, and then a standard with a dragon,
  and then a grett nombur of ye servants in blake, and then anoder standard
  with a whyt greyhound." Later on in the procession came "ye grett baner
  of armes in brodery and with dyvers odere baners."</p>

  <p>Standards varied in size according to the rank of the person entitled
  to them. A MS. of the time of Henry VII. gives the following
  dimensions:&mdash;For that of the king, a length of eight yards; for a
  duke, seven; for an earl, six; a marquis, six and a half; a viscount,
  five and a half; a baron, five; a knight banneret, four and a half; and
  for a knight, four yards. In view of these figures one can easily realise
  the derivation of the word standard&mdash;a thing that is meant to stand;
  to be rather fastened in the ground as a rallying point than carried,
  like a banner, about the field of action. <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="029.png"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span></p>

  <p>At the funeral of Nelson we find his banner of arms and standard borne
  in the procession, while around his coffin are the bannerolls, square
  banner-like flags bearing the various arms of his family lineage. We see
  these latter again in an old print of the funeral procession of General
  Monk, in 1670, and in a still older print of the burial of Sir Philip
  Sydney, four of his near kindred carrying by the coffin these indications
  of his descent. At the funeral of Queen Elizabeth we find six bannerolls
  of alliances on the paternal side and six on the maternal. The standard
  of Nelson bears his motto, "<i>Palmam qui meruit ferat</i>," but instead
  of the Cross of St. George it has the union of the crosses of St. George,
  St. Andrew, and St. Patrick, since in 1806, the year of his funeral, the
  England of mediæval days had expanded into the Kingdom of Great Britain
  and Ireland. In the imposing funeral procession of the great Duke of
  Wellington we find again amongst the flags not only the national flag,
  regimental colours, and other insignia, but the ten bannerolls of the
  Duke's pedigree and descent, and his personal banner and standard.</p>

  <p>Richard, Earl of Salisbury, in the year 1458, ordered that at his
  interment "there be banners, standards, and other accoutrements,
  according as was usual for a person of his degree" and what was then held
  fitting, remains, in the case of State funerals, equally so at the
  present day.</p>

  <p>The Pennon is a small, narrow flag, forked or swallow-tailed at its
  extremity. This was carried on the lance. Our readers will recall the
  knight in "Marmion," who</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"On high his forky pennon bore,</p>
      <p>Like swallow's tail in shape and hue."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We read in the Roll of Karlaverok, as early as the year 1300, of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Many a beautiful pennon fixed to a lance,</p>
      <p>And many a banner displayed;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and of the knight in Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," we hear that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"By hys bannere borne is hys pennon</p>
      <p>Of golde full riche."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The pennon bore the arms of the knight, and they were in the earlier
  days of chivalry so emblazoned upon it as to appear in their proper
  position not when the lance was held erect but when held horizontally for
  the charge. The earliest brass now extant, that of Sir John Daubernoun,
  at Stoke d'Abernon Church, in Surrey, represents the knight as bearing a
  lance with pennon. Its date is 1277, and the device is a golden chevron
  on a field of azure. In <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum" title="030.png"
  ><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>this example the pennon, instead of
  being forked, comes to a single point.</p>

  <p>The pennon was the ensign of those knights who were not bannerets, and
  the bearers of it were therefore sometimes called pennonciers; the term
  is derived from the Latin word for a feather, <i>penna</i>, from the
  narrow, elongated form. The pennons of our lancer regiments (Fig. <a
  href="#fig30">30</a>) give one a good idea of the form, size, and general
  effect of the ancient knightly pennon, though they do not bear
  distinctive charges upon them, and thus fail in one notable essential to
  recall to our minds the brilliant blazonry and variety of device that
  must have been so marked and effective a feature when the knights of old
  took the field. In a drawing of the year 1813, of the Royal Horse
  Artillery, we find the men armed with lances, and these with pennons of
  blue and white, as we see in Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>.<a
  name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of the thirty-seven pennons borne on lances by various knights
  represented in the Bayeux tapestry, twenty-eight have triple points,
  while others have two, four, or five. The devices upon these pennons are
  very various and distinctive, though the date is before the period of the
  definite establishment of heraldry. Examples of these may be seen in
  Figs. <a href="#fig39">39</a>, <a href="#fig40">40</a>, <a
  href="#fig41">41</a>, <a href="#fig42">42</a>.</p>

  <p>The pennoncelle, or pencel, is a diminutive of the pennon, small as
  that itself is. Such flags were often supplied in large quantities at any
  special time of rejoicing or of mourning. At the burial in the year 1554
  of "the nobull Duke of Norffok," we note amongst other items "a dosen of
  banerolles of ys progene," a standard, a "baner of damaske, and xij dosen
  penselles." At the burial of Sir William Goring we find "ther was viij
  dosen of penselles," while at the Lord Mayor's procession in 1555 we read
  that there were "ij goodly pennes [State barges] deckt with flages and
  stremers and a m penselles." This "m," or thousand, we can perhaps
  scarcely take literally, though in another instance we find "the cordes
  were hanged with innumerable pencelles."<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The statement of the cost of the funeral of Oliver Cromwell is
  interesting, as we see therein the divers kinds of flags that graced the
  ceremony. The total cost of the affair was over £28,000, and the unhappy
  undertaker, a Mr. Rolt, was paid very little, if any, of his bill. The
  items include "six gret banners wrought on rich taffaty in oil, and gilt
  with fine gold," at £6 each. Five large standards, similarly wrought, at
  a cost of £10 each; six dozen <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum" title="031.png"
  ><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>pennons, a yard long, at a sovereign
  each; forty trumpet banners, at forty shillings apiece; thirty dozen of
  pennoncelles, a foot long, at twenty shillings a dozen; and twenty dozen
  ditto at twelve shillings the dozen. Poor Rolt!</p>

  <p>In "the accompte and reckonyng" for the Lord Mayor's Show of 1617 we
  find "payde to Jacob Challoner, painter, for a greate square banner, the
  Prince's Armes, the somme of seven pounds." We also find, "More to him
  for the new payntyng and guyldyng of ten trumpet banners, for payntyng
  and guyldyng of two long pennons of the Lord Maior's armes on callicoe,"
  and many other items that we need not set down, the total cost of the
  flag department being £67 15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, while for the Lord
  Mayor's Show of the year 1685 we find that the charge for this item was
  the handsome sum of £140.</p>

  <p>The Pennant, or pendant, is a long narrow flag with pointed end, and
  derives its name from the Latin word signifying to hang. Examples of it
  may be seen in Figs. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <a href="#fig21">21</a>, <a
  href="#fig23">23</a>, <a href="#fig24">24</a>, <a href="#fig36">36</a>,
  <a href="#fig38">38</a>, <a href="#fig100">100</a>, <a
  href="#fig101">101</a>, <a href="#fig102">102</a>, and <a
  href="#fig103">103</a>, and some of the flags employed in ship-signalling
  are also of pennant form. It was in Tudor times called the streamer.
  Though such a flag may at times be found pressed into the service of city
  pageantry, it is more especially adapted for use at sea, since the lofty
  mast, the open space far removed from telegraph-wires, chimney-pots, and
  such-like hindrances to its free course, and the crisp sea-breeze to
  boldly extend it to its full length, are all essential to its due
  display. When we once begin to extend in length, it is evident that
  almost anything is possible: the pendant of a modern man-of-war is some
  twenty yards long, while its breadth is barely six inches, and it is
  evident that such a flag as that would scarcely get a fair chance in the
  general "survival of the fittest" in Cheapside. It is charged at the head
  with the Cross of St. George. Figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a>, <a
  href="#fig27">27</a>, <a href="#fig74">74</a> are Tudor examples of such
  pendants, while Fig. <a href="#fig140">140</a> is a portion at least of
  the pendant flown by colonial vessels on war service, while under the
  same necessarily abbreviated conditions may be seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig151">151</a> the pendant of the United States Navy, in <a
  href="#fig157">157</a> that of Chili, and in <a href="#fig173">173</a>
  that of Brazil.</p>

  <p>In mediæval days many devices were introduced, the streamer being made
  of sufficient width to allow of their display. Thus Dugdale gives an
  account of the fitting up of the ship in which Beauchamp, fifth Earl of
  Warwick, during the reign of Henry VI., went over to France. The original
  bill between this nobleman and William Seburgh, "citizen and payntour of
  London," is still extant, and we see from it that amongst other things
  provided was "the grete stremour for the shippe xl yardes in length and
  viij yardes in brede." These noble dimensions gave ample room for <!--
  Page 21 --><span class="pagenum" title="032.png"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>display of the badge of the Warwicks,<a
  name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> so we find it at the head
  adorned with "a grete bere holding a ragged staffe," and the rest of its
  length "powdrid full of raggid staves,"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>

  <p>Machyn tells us in his diary for August 3rd, 1553, how "The Queen came
  riding to London, and so on to the Tower, makyng her entry at Aldgate,
  and a grett nombur of stremars hanging about the sayd gate, and all the
  strett unto Leydenhalle and unto the Tower were layd with graffel, and
  all the crafts of London stood with their banars and stremars hangyd over
  their heds." In the picture by Volpe in the collection at Hampton Court
  of the Embarkation of Henry VIII. from Dover in the year 1520, to meet
  Francis I. at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, we find, very naturally, a
  great variety and display of flags of all kinds. Figs. <a
  href="#fig20">20</a>, <a href="#fig21">21</a>, <a href="#fig23">23</a>
  are streamers therein depicted, the portcullis, Tudor rose, and
  fleur-de-lys being devices of the English king, while the particular
  ground upon which they are displayed is in each case made up of green and
  white, the Tudor livery colours. We may see these again in Fig. <a
  href="#fig71">71</a>, where the national flag of the Cross of St. George
  has its white field barred with the Tudor green. In the year 1554 even
  the naval uniform of England was white and green, both for officers and
  mariners, and the City trained bands had white coats welted with green.
  Queen Elizabeth, though of the Tudor race, took scarlet and black as her
  livery colours; the House of Plantaganet white and red; of York, murrey
  and blue; of Lancaster, white and blue; of Stuart, red and yellow. The
  great nobles each also had their special liveries; thus in a grand review
  of troops on Blackheath, on May 16th, 1552, we find that "the Yerle of
  Pembroke and ys men of armes" had "cotes blake bordered with whyt," while
  the retainers of the Lord Chamberlain were in red and white, those of the
  Earl of Huntingdon in blue, and so forth.</p>

  <p>In the description of one of the City pageants in honour of Henry VII.
  we find among the "baggs" (<i>i.e.</i>, badges), "a rede rose and a wyght
  in his mydell, golde floures de luces, and portcullis also in golde," the
  "wallys" of the Pavilion whereon these were displayed being "chekkyrs of
  whyte and grene."</p>

  <p>The only other flag form to which we need make any very definite
  reference is the Guidon. The word is derived from the <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum" title="033.png"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>French <i>guide-homme</i>, but in the lax
  spelling of mediæval days it undergoes many perversions, such as
  guydhome, guydon, gytton, geton, and such-like more or less barbarous
  renderings. Guidon is the regulation name now applied to the small
  standards borne by the squadrons of some of our cavalry regiments. The
  Queen's guidon is borne by the first squadron; this is always of crimson
  silk; the others are the colour of the regimental facings. The modern
  cavalry guidon is square in form, and richly embroidered, fringed, and
  tasselled. A mediæval writer on the subject lays down the law that "a
  guydhome must be two and a half yardes or three yardes longe, and therein
  shall be no armes putt, but only the man's crest, cognizance, and device,
  and from that, from his standard or streamer a man may flee; but not from
  his banner or pennon bearinge his armes." The guidon is largely employed
  at State or ceremonious funeral processions; we see it borne, for
  instance, in the illustrations of the funeral of Monk in 1670, of Nelson
  in 1806, of Wellington in 1852. In all these cases it is rounded in form,
  as in Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>. Like the standard, the guidon bears
  motto and device, but it is smaller, and has not the elongated form, nor
  does it bear the Cross of St. George.</p>

  <p>In divers countries and periods very diverse forms may be encountered,
  and to these various names have been assigned, but it is needless to
  pursue their investigation at any length, as in some cases the forms are
  quite obsolete; in other cases, while its form is known to us its name is
  lost, while in yet other instances we have various old names of flags
  mentioned by the chroniclers and poets to which we are unable now to
  assign any very definite notion of their form. In some cases, again, the
  form we encounter may be of some eccentric individuality that no man ever
  saw before, or ever wants to see again, or, as in Fig. <a
  href="#fig33">33</a>, so slightly divergent from ordinary type as to
  scarcely need a distinctive name. One of the flags represented in the
  Bayeux tapestry is semi-circular. Fig. <a href="#fig32">32</a> defies
  classification, unless we regard it as a pennon that, by snipping, has
  travelled three-quarters of the way towards being a banner. Fig. <a
  href="#fig35">35</a>, sketched from a MS. of the early part of the
  fourteenth century, in the British Museum, is of somewhat curious and
  abnormal form. It is of religious type, and bears the Agnus Dei. The
  original is in a letter of Philippe de Mezières, pleading for peace and
  friendship between Charles VI. of France and Richard II. of England.</p>

  <p>Flags are nowadays ordinarily made of bunting, a woollen fabric which,
  from the nature of its texture and its great toughness and durability, is
  particularly fitted to stand wear and tear. It comes from the Yorkshire
  mills in pieces of forty yards in length, while the width varies from
  four to thirty-six inches. Flags are <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="034.png"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>only
  printed when of small size, and when a sufficient number will be required
  to justify the expense of cutting the blocks. Silk is also used, but only
  for special purposes.</p>

  <p>Flag-devising is really a branch of heraldry, and should be in
  accordance with its laws, both in the forms and the colours introduced.
  Yellow in blazonry is the equivalent of gold, and white of silver, and it
  is one of the requirements of heraldry that colour should not be placed
  upon colour, nor metal on metal. Hence the red and blue in the French
  tricolour (Fig. <a href="#fig191">191</a>) are separated by white; the
  black and red of Belgium (Fig. <a href="#fig236">236</a>) by yellow. Such
  unfortunate combinations as the yellow, blue, red, of Venezuela (Fig. <a
  href="#fig170">170</a>); the yellow, red, green of Bolivia (Fig. <a
  href="#fig171">171</a>); the red and blue of Hayti (Fig. 178); the white
  and yellow of Guatemala (Fig. <a href="#fig162">162</a>), are violations
  of the rule in countries far removed from the influence of heraldic law.
  This latter instance is a peculiarly interesting one; it is the flag of
  Guatemala in 1851, while in 1858 this was changed to that represented in
  Fig. <a href="#fig163">163</a>. In the first case the red and the blue
  are in contact, and the white and the yellow; while in the second the
  same colours are introduced, but with due regard to heraldic law, and
  certainly with far more pleasing effect.</p>

  <p>One sees the same obedience to this rule in the special flags used for
  signalling, where great clearness of definition at considerable distances
  is an essential. Such combinations as blue and black, red and blue,
  yellow and white, carry their own condemnation with them, as anyone may
  test by actual experiment; stripes of red and blue, for instance, at a
  little distance blending into purple, while white and yellow are too much
  alike in strength, and when the yellow has become a little faded and the
  white a little dingy they appear almost identical. We have this latter
  combination in Fig. <a href="#fig198">198</a>, the flag of the now
  vanished Papal States. It is a very uncommon juxtaposition, and only
  occurs in this case from a special religious symbolism into which we need
  not here enter. The alternate red and green stripes in Fig. <a
  href="#fig63">63</a> are another violation of the rule, and have a very
  confusing effect.<a name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The colours of by far the greatest frequency of occurrence are red,
  white, and blue; yellow also is not uncommon; orange is only found once,
  in Fig. <a href="#fig249">249</a>, where it has a special significance,
  since this is the flag of the Orange Free State. Green occurs sparingly.
  Italy (Fig. <a href="#fig197">197</a>) is perhaps the best known example.
  We also find it in the Brazilian flag (Fig. <a href="#fig169">169</a>),
  the Mexican (Fig. <a href="#fig172">172</a>), in the Hungarian tricolor
  (Fig. <a href="#fig214">214</a>), and in Figs. <a href="#fig199">199</a>,
  <a href="#fig201">201</a>, <a href="#fig209">209</a>, the flags <!-- Page
  24 --><span class="pagenum" title="035.png"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>of smaller German States, but it is more
  especially associated with Mohammedan States, as in Figs. <a
  href="#fig58">58</a>, <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <a href="#fig64">64</a>,
  <a href="#fig235">235</a>. Black is found but seldom, but as heraldic
  requirements necessitate that it should be combined either with white or
  yellow, it is, when seen, exceptionally brilliant and effective. We see
  it, for example, in the Royal Standard of Spain, (Fig. <a
  href="#fig194">194</a>), in Figs. <a href="#fig207">207</a> and <a
  href="#fig208">208</a>, flags of the German Empire, in Fig. <a
  href="#fig226">226</a>, the Imperial Standard of Russia, and in Fig. <a
  href="#fig236">236</a>, the brilliant tricolor of the Belgians.<a
  name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In orthodox flags anything of the nature of an inscription is very
  seldom seen. We find a reference to order and progress on the Brazilian
  flag (Fig. <a href="#fig169">169</a>), while the Turkish Imperial
  Standard (Fig. <a href="#fig238">238</a>) bears on its scarlet folds the
  monogram of the Sultan; but these exceptions are rare.<a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> We have seen that, on the contrary, on
  the flags of insurgents and malcontents the inscription often counts for
  much. On the alteration of the style in the year 1752 this necessary
  change was made the subject of much ignorant reproach of the government
  of the day, and was used as a weapon of party warfare. An amusing
  instance of this feeling occurs in the first plate of Hogarth's election
  series, where a malcontent, or perhaps only a man anxious to earn a
  shilling, carries a big flag inscribed, "Give us back our eleven days."
  The flags of the Covenanters often bore mottoes or texts. Fig. <a
  href="#fig34">34</a> is a curious example: the flag hoisted by the crew
  of H.M.S. <i>Niger</i> when they opposed the mutineers in 1797 at
  Sheerness. It is preserved in the Royal United Service Museum. It is, as
  we have seen, ordinarily the insubordinate and rebellious who break out
  into inscriptions of more or less piety or pungency, but we may conclude
  that the loyal sailors fighting under the royal flag adopted this device
  in addition as one means the more of fighting the rebels with their own
  weapons.</p>

  <p>During the Civil War between the Royalists and Parliamentarians, we
  find a great use made of flags inscribed with mottoes. Thus, on one we
  see five hands stretching at a crown defended by an armed hand issuing
  from a cloud, and the motto, "Reddite Cæsari." In another we see an angel
  with a flaming sword treading a dragon underfoot, and the motto, "Quis ut
  Deus," while yet another is inscribed, "Courage pour la Cause." On a
  fourth we find an ermine, and the motto, "Malo mori quam
  f&oelig;dari"&mdash;"It is better to die than <!-- Page 25 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="036.png"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>to be
  sullied," in allusion to the old belief that the ermine would die rather
  than soil its fur. Hence it is the emblem of purity and stainless
  honour.</p>

  <p>The blood-red flag is the symbol of mutiny and of revolution. As a
  sign of disaffection it was twice, at the end of last century, displayed
  in the Royal Navy. A mutiny broke out at Portsmouth in April, 1797, for
  an advance of pay; an Act of Parliament was passed to sanction the
  increase of expenditure, and all who were concerned in it received the
  royal pardon, but in June of the same year, at Sheerness, the spirit of
  disaffection broke out afresh, and on its suppression the ringleaders
  were executed. It is characteristic that, aggrieved as these seamen were
  against the authorities, when the King's birthday came round, on June
  4th, though the mutiny was then at its height, the red flags were
  lowered, the vessels gaily dressed in the regulation bunting, and a royal
  salute was fired. Having thus demonstrated their real loyalty to their
  sovereign, the red flags were re-hoisted, and the dispute with the
  Admiralty resumed in all its bitterness.</p>

  <p>The white flag is the symbol of amity and of good will; of truce
  amidst strife, and of surrender when the cause is lost. The yellow flag
  betokens infectious illness, and is displayed when there is cholera,
  yellow fever, or such like dangerous malady on board ship, and it is also
  hoisted on quarantine stations. The black flag signifies mourning and
  death; one of its best known uses in these later days is to serve as an
  indication after an execution that the requirements of the law have been
  duly carried out.</p>

  <p>Honour and respect are expressed by "dipping" the flag. At any parade
  of troops before the sovereign the regimental flags are lowered as they
  pass the saluting point, and at sea the colours are dipped by hauling
  them smartly down from the mast-head and then promptly replacing them.
  They must not be suffered to remain at all stationary when lowered, as a
  flag flying half-mast high is a sign of mourning for death, for defeat,
  or for some other national loss, and it is scarcely a mark of honour or
  respect to imply that the arrival of the distinguished person is a cause
  of grief or matter for regret.</p>

  <p>In time of peace it is an insult to hoist the flag of one friendly
  nation above another, so that each flag must be flown from its own
  staff.</p>

  <p>Even as early as the reign of Alfred England claimed the sovereignty
  of the seas. Edward III. is more identified with our early naval glories
  than any other English king; he was styled "King of the Seas," a name of
  which he appears to have been very proud, and in his coinage of gold
  nobles he represented himself with shield and sword, and standing in a
  ship "full royally <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum" title="037.png"
  ><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>apparelled." He fought on the seas under
  many disadvantages of numbers and ships: in one instance until his ship
  sank under him, and at all times as a gallant Englishman.</p>

  <p>If any commander of an English vessel met the ship of a foreigner, and
  the latter refused to salute the English flag, it was enacted that such
  ship, if taken, was the lawful prize of the captain. A very notable
  example of this punctilious insistance on the respect to the flag arose
  in May, 1554, when a Spanish fleet of one hundred and sixty sail,
  escorting the King on his way to England to his marriage with Queen Mary,
  fell in with the English fleet under the command of Lord Howard, Lord
  High Admiral. Philip would have passed the English fleet without paying
  the customary honours, but the signal was at once made by Howard for his
  twenty-eight ships to prepare for action, and a round shot crashed into
  the side of the vessel of the Spanish Admiral. The hint was promptly
  taken, and the whole Spanish fleet struck their colours as homage to the
  English flag.</p>

  <p>In the year 1635 the combined fleets of France and Holland determined
  to dispute this claim of Great Britain, but on announcing their intention
  of doing so an English fleet was at once dispatched, whereupon they
  returned to their ports and decided that discretion was preferable even
  to valour. In 1654, on the conclusion of peace between England and
  Holland, the Dutch consented to acknowledge the English supremacy of the
  seas, the article in the treaty declaring that "the ships of the
  Dutch&mdash;as well ships of war as others&mdash;meeting any of the ships
  of war of the English, in the British seas, shall strike their flags and
  lower their topsails in such manner as hath ever been at any time
  heretofore practised." After another period of conflict it was again
  formally yielded by the Dutch in 1673.</p>

  <p>Political changes are responsible for many variations in flags, and
  the wear and tear of Time soon renders many of the devices obsolete. On
  turning, for instance, to Nories' "Maritime Flags of all Nations," a
  little book published in 1848, many of the flags are at once seen to be
  now out of date. The particular year was one of exceptional political
  agitation, and the author evidently felt that his work was almost
  old-fashioned even on its issue. "The accompanying illustrations," he
  says, "having been completed prior to the recent revolutionary movements
  on the Continent of Europe, it has been deemed expedient to issue the
  plate in its present state, rather than adopt the various tri-coloured
  flags, which cannot be regarded as permanently established in the present
  unsettled state of political affairs." The Russian American Company's
  flag, Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, that of the States of the Church, of
  the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Turkish Imperial Standard, Fig. <a
  href="#fig64">64</a>, and many others <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="038.png"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>that he
  gives, are all now superseded. For Venice he gives two flags, that for
  war and that for the merchant service. In each case the flag is scarlet,
  having a broad band of blue, which we may take to typify the sea, near
  its lower edge. From this rises in gold the winged lion of St. Mark,
  having in the war ensign a sword in his right paw, and in the peaceful
  colours of commerce a cross. Of thirty-five "flags of all nations," given
  as a supplement to the <i>Illustrated London News</i> in 1858, we note
  that eleven are now obsolete: the East India Company, for instance, being
  now extinct, the Ionian Islands ceded to Greece, Tuscany and Naples
  absorbed into Italy, and so forth.</p>

  <p>In Figs. <a href="#fig52">52</a> and <a href="#fig53">53</a> we have
  examples of early Spanish flags, and in <a href="#fig54">54</a> and <a
  href="#fig55">55</a> of Portuguese, each and all being taken from a very
  quaint map of the year 1502. This map may be said to be practically the
  countries lying round the Atlantic Ocean, giving a good slice of Africa,
  a portion of the Mediterranean basin, the British Isles, most of South
  America, a little of North America, the West Indies,<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> etc., the object of the map being to
  show the division that Pope Alexander VI. kindly made between those
  faithful daughters of the Church&mdash;Spain and Portugal&mdash;of all
  the unclaimed portions of the world. Figs. <a href="#fig52">52</a> and <a
  href="#fig53">53</a> are types of flags flying on various Spanish
  possessions, while Figs. <a href="#fig54">54</a> and <a
  href="#fig55">55</a> are placed at different points on the map where
  Portugal held sway. On one place in Africa we see that No. <a
  href="#fig54">54</a> is surmounted by a white flag bearing the Cross of
  St. George, so we may conclude that&mdash;Pope Alexander
  notwithstanding&mdash;England captured it from the Portuguese. At one
  African town we see the black men dancing round the Portuguese flag,
  while a little way off three of their brethren are hanging on a gallows,
  showing that civilization had set in with considerable severity there.
  The next illustration on this plate (Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>) is
  taken from a sheet of flags published in 1735; it represents the "Guiny
  Company's Ensign," a trading company, like the East India, Fig. <a
  href="#fig57">57</a>, now no longer in existence. Fig. <a
  href="#fig62">62</a> is the flag of Savoy, an ancient sovereignty that,
  within the memory of many of our readers, has expanded into the kingdom
  of Italy. The break up of the Napoleonic <i>régime</i> in France, the
  crushing out of the Confederate States in North America, the dismissal
  from the throne of the Emperor of Brazil, have all, within comparatively
  recent years, led to the superannuation and disestablishment of a goodly
  number of flags and their final disappearance.</p>

  <p>We propose now to deal with the flags of the various nationalities,
  commencing, naturally, with those of our own country. <!-- Page 28
  --><span class="pagenum" title="039.png"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>We were told by a government official that
  the Universal Code of signals issued by England had led to a good deal of
  heartburning, as it is prefaced by a plate of the various national flags,
  the Union Flag of Great Britain and Ireland being placed first. But until
  some means can be devised by which each nationality can head the list,
  some sort of precedence seems inevitable. At first sight it seems as
  though susceptibilities might be saved by adopting an alphabetical
  arrangement, but this is soon found to be a mistake, as it places such
  powerful States as Russia and the United States nearly at the bottom of
  the list. A writer, Von Rosenfeld, who published a book on flags in
  Vienna in 1853, very naturally adopted this arrangement, but the calls of
  patriotism would not even then allow him to be quite consistent, since he
  places his material as follows:&mdash;Austria, Annam, Argentine, Belgium,
  Bolivia, and so forth, where it is evident Annam should lead the world
  and Austria be content to come in third. Apart from the difficulty of
  asking Spain, for instance, to admit that Bulgaria was so much in front
  of her, or to expect Japan to allow China so great a precedence as the
  alphabetical arrangement favours, a second obstacle is found in the fact
  that the names of these various States as we Englishmen know them are not
  in many cases those by which they know themselves or are known by others.
  Thus a Frenchman would be quite content with the alphabetical arrangement
  that in English places his beloved country before Germany, but the Teuton
  would at once claim precedence, declaring that Deutschland must come
  before "la belle France," and the Espagnol would not see why he should be
  banished to the back row just because we choose to call him a
  Spaniard.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, pending the Millenium, the flag that more than three
  hundred millions of people, the wide world over, look up to as the symbol
  of justice and liberty, will serve very well as a starting point, and
  then the great Daughter across the Western Ocean, that sprung from the
  Old Home, shall claim a worthy place next in our regard. The Continent of
  Europe must clearly come next, and such American nationalities as lie
  outside the United States, together with Asia and Africa, will bring up
  the rear.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Foremost amongst the flags of the British Empire the Royal Standard
  takes its position as the symbol of the tie that unites all into one
  great State. Its glowing blazonry of blue and scarlet and gold is brought
  before us in Fig. <a href="#fig44">44</a>. The three golden lions on the
  scarlet ground are the device of England, the golden harp on the azure
  field is the device of Ireland, while the ruddy lion rampant on the field
  of gold<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> stands for
  Scotland. It may perhaps appear to some of our readers that the standard
  of the Empire should not be confined to such narrow limits; that the
  great Dominion of Canada, India, Australia, the ever-growing South
  Africa, might justly claim a place. Precedent, too, might be urged, since
  in previous reigns, Nassau, Hanover, and other States have found a
  resting-place in its folds, and there is much to be said in favour of a
  wider representation of the greater component parts of our world-wide
  Empire; but two great practical difficulties arise: the first is that the
  grand simplicity of the flag would be lost if eight or ten different
  devices were substituted for the three; and secondly, it would very
  possibly give rise to a good deal of jealousy and ill-feeling, since it
  would be impossible to introduce all. As it at present stands, it
  represents the central home of the Empire, the little historic seed-plot
  from whence all else has sprung, and to which all turn their eyes as the
  <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum" title="041.png"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>centre of the national life. All equally
  agree to venerate the dear mother land, but it is perhaps a little too
  much to expect that the people of Jamaica or Hong Kong would feel the
  same veneration for the beaver and maple-leaves of Canada, the golden Sun
  of India, or the Southern Cross of Australasia. As it must clearly be all
  or none, it seems that only one solution of the problem, the present one,
  is possible. In the same way the Union flag (Fig. <a
  href="#fig90">90</a>) is literally but the symbol of England, Scotland,
  and Ireland, but far and away outside its primary significance, it floats
  on every sea the emblem of that Greater Britain in which all its sons
  have equal pride, and where all share equal honour as brethren of one
  family.</p>

  <p>The earliest Royal Standard bore but the three lions of England, and
  we shall see presently that in different reigns various modifications of
  its blazonry arose, either the result of conquest or of dynastic
  possessions. Thus Figs. <a href="#fig43">43</a> and <a
  href="#fig44">44</a>, though they bear a superficial likeness, tell a
  very different story; the first of these, that of George III., laying
  claim in its fourth quartering to lordship over Hanover and other German
  States, and in its second quarter to the entirely shadowy and obsolete
  claim over France, as typified by the golden fleurs-de-lys on the field
  of azure.</p>

  <p>How the three lions of England arose is by no means clear. Two lions
  were assigned as the arms of William the Conqueror, but there is no real
  evidence that he bore them. Heraldry had not then become a definite
  science, and when it did a custom sprang up of assigning to those who
  lived and died before its birth certain arms, the kindly theory being
  that such persons, had they been then living, would undoubtedly have
  borne arms, and that it was hard, therefore, that the mere accident of
  being born a hundred years too soon should debar them from possessing
  such recognition of their rank. Even so late as Henry II. the bearing is
  still traditional, and it is said that on his marriage with Alianore,
  eldest daughter of William, Duke of Aquitaine and Guienne, he
  incorporated with his own two lions the single lion that (it is asserted)
  was the device of his father-in-law. All this, however, is theory and
  surmise, and we do not really find ourselves on the solid ground of fact
  until we come to the reign of Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion. Upon his second
  Great Seal we have the three lions just as they are represented in Figs.
  <a href="#fig22">22</a>, <a href="#fig43">43</a>, <a
  href="#fig44">44</a>, and as they have been borne for centuries by
  successive sovereigns on their arms, standards, and coinage, and as our
  readers may see them this day on the Royal Standard and on much of the
  money they may take out of their pockets. The date of this Great Seal of
  King Richard is 1195 <span class="sm">A.D.</span>, so we have, at all
  events, a period of over seven hundred years, waiving a break during the
  Commonwealth, in which the three golden lions on their scarlet field have
  typified the might of England. <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum" title="042.png"
  ><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span></p>

  <p>The rampant lion within the tressure, the device of
  Scotland&mdash;seen in the second quarter of our Royal Standard, Fig. <a
  href="#fig44">44</a>&mdash;is first seen on the Great Seal of King
  Alexander II., about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1230, and the same
  device, without any modification of colour or form<a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> was borne by all the Sovereigns of
  Scotland, and on the accession of James to the throne of the United
  Kingdom, in the year 1603, the ruddy lion ramping on the field of gold
  became an integral part of the Standard.</p>

  <p>The Scotch took considerable umbrage at their lion being placed in the
  second place, while the lions of England were placed first, as they
  asserted that Scotland was a more ancient kingdom than England, and that
  in any case, on the death of Queen Elizabeth of England, the Scottish
  monarch virtually annexed the Southern Kingdom to his own, and kindly
  undertook to get the Southerners out of a dynastic difficulty by looking
  after the interests of England as well as ruling Scotland. This feeling
  of jealousy was so bitter and so potent that for many years after the
  Union, on all seals peculiar to Scottish business and on the flags
  displayed north of the Tweed, the arms of Scotland were placed in the
  first quarter. It was also made a subject of complaint that in the Union
  Flag the cross of St. George is placed over that of St. Andrew (see Figs.
  <a href="#fig90">90</a>, <a href="#fig91">91</a>, <a
  href="#fig92">92</a>), and that the lion of England acted as the dexter
  support of the royal shield instead of giving place to the Scottish
  Unicorn. One can only be thankful that Irish patriots have been too
  sensible or too indifferent to insist upon yet another modification,
  requiring that whensoever and wheresoever the Royal Standard be hoisted
  in the Emerald Isle the Irish harp should be placed in the first quarter.
  While it is clearly impossible to place the device of each nationality
  first, it is very desirable and, in fact, essential, that the National
  Arms and the Royal Standard should be identical in arrangement in all
  parts of the kingdom. The notion of unity would be very inadequately
  carried out if we had a London version for Buckingham Palace, an
  Edinburgh version for Holyrood, and presently found the Isle of Saints
  and "gallant little Wales" insisting on two other variants, and the Isle
  of Man in insurrection because it was not allowed precedence of all
  four.</p>

  <p>Even so lately as the year 1853, on the issue of the florin, the old
  jealousy blazed up again. A statement was drawn up and presented to Lord
  Lyon, King of Arms, setting forth anew the old grievances of the lions in
  the Standard and the crosses in the Flag of the Union, and adding that
  "the new two-shilling <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum" title="043.png"
  ><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>piece, called a florin, which has lately
  been issued, bears upon the reverse four crowned shields, the first or
  uppermost being the three lions passant of England; the second, or right
  hand proper, the harp of Ireland; the third, or left hand proper, the
  lion rampant of Scotland; the fourth, or lower, the three lions of
  England repeated. Your petitioners beg to direct your Lordship's
  attention to the position occupied by the arms of Scotland upon this
  coin, which are placed in the third shield instead of the second, a
  preference being given to the arms of Ireland over those of this
  kingdom." It is curious that this document tacitly drops claim to the
  first place. Probably most of our readers&mdash;Scotch, Irish, or
  English&mdash;feel but little sense of grievance in the matter, and are
  quite willing, if the coin be an insult, to pocket it.</p>

  <p>The border surrounding the lion is heraldically known as the tressure.
  The date and the cause of its introduction are lost in antiquity. The
  mythical story is that it was added by Achaius, King of Scotland, in the
  year 792, in token of alliance with Charlemagne, but in all probability
  these princes scarcely knew of the existence of each other. The French
  and the Scotch have often been in alliance, and there can be little doubt
  but that the fleurs-de-lys that adorn the tressure point to some such
  early association of the two peoples; an ancient writer, Nisbet, takes
  the same view, as he affirms that "the Tressure fleurie encompasses the
  lyon of Scotland to show that he should defend the Flower-de-luses, and
  these to continue a defence to the lyon." The first authentic
  illustration of the tressure in the arms of Scotland dates from the year
  1260. In the reign of James III., in the year 1471 it was "ordaint that
  in tyme to cum thar suld be na double tresor about his armys, but that he
  suld ber armys of the lyoun, without ony mur." If this ever took effect
  it must have been for a very short time. We have seen no example of
  it.</p>

  <p>Ireland joined England and Scotland in political union on January 1st,
  1801, but its device&mdash;the harp&mdash;was placed on the standard
  centuries before by right of conquest. The first known suggestion for a
  real union on equal terms was made in the year 1642 in a pamphlet
  entitled "The Generall Junto, or the Councell of Union; chosen equally
  out of England, Scotland, and Ireland for the better compacting of these
  nations into one monarchy. By H. P." This H. P. was one Henry Parker.
  Fifty copies only of this tract were issued, and those entirely for
  private circulation. "To persuade to union and commend the benefit of
  it"&mdash;says the author&mdash;"will be unnecessary. <i>Divide et
  impera</i> (divide and rule) is a fit saying for one who aims at the
  dissipation and perdition of his country. Honest counsellors have ever
  given contrary advice. England and Ireland are inseparably knit; no
  severance is possible <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum" title="044.png"
  ><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>but such as shall be violent and
  injurious. Ireland is an integral member of the Kingdom of England: both
  kingdoms are coinvested and connexed, not more undivided than Wales or
  Cornwall."</p>

  <p>The conquest of Ireland was entered upon in the year 1172, in the
  reign of Henry II., but was scarcely completed until the surrender of
  Limerick in 1691. Until 1542 it was styled not the Kingdom but the
  Lordship of Ireland.</p>

  <p>An early standard of Ireland has three golden crowns on a blue field,
  and arranged over each other as we see the English lions placed; and a
  commission appointed in the reign of Edward IV., to enquire what really
  were the arms of Ireland, reported in favour of the three crowns. The
  early Irish coinage bears these three crowns upon it, as on the coins of
  Henry V. and his successors. Henry VIII. substituted the harp on the
  coins, but neither crowns nor harps nor any other device for Ireland
  appear in the Royal Standard until the year 1603, after which date the
  harp has remained in continuous use till the present day.</p>

  <p>In the Harleian MS., No. 304 in the British Museum, we find the
  statement that "the armes of Irland is Gules iij old harpes gold,
  stringed argent" (as in Fig. <a href="#fig87">87</a>), and on the silver
  coinage for Ireland of Queen Elizabeth the shield bears these three
  harps. At her funeral Ireland was represented by a blue flag having a
  crowned harp of gold upon it, and James I. adopted this, but without the
  crown, as a quartering in his standard: its first appearance on the Royal
  Standard of England.</p>

  <p>Why Henry VIII. substituted the harp for the three crowns is not
  really known. Some would have us believe that the king was apprehensive
  that the three crowns might be taken as symbolising the triple crown of
  the Pope; while others suggest that Henry, being presented by the Pope
  with the supposed harp of Brian Boru, was induced to change the arms of
  Ireland by placing on her coins the representation of this relic of her
  most celebrated native king. The Earl of Northampton, writing in the
  reign of James I., suggests yet a third explanation. "The best reason,"
  saith he, "that I can observe for the bearing thereof is, it resembles
  that country in being such an instrument that it requires more cost to
  keep it in tune than it is worth."<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum" title="045.png"
  ><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span></p>

  <p>The Royal Standard should only be hoisted when the Sovereign or some
  member of the royal family is actually within the palace or castle, or at
  the saluting point, or on board the vessel where we see it flying, though
  this rule is by no means observed in practice. The only exception really
  permitted to this is that on certain royal anniversaries it is hoisted at
  some few fortresses at home and abroad that are specified in the Queen's
  Regulations.</p>

  <p>The Royal Standard of England was, we have seen, in its earliest form
  a scarlet flag, having three golden lions upon it, and it was so borne by
  Richard I., John, Henry III., Edward I., and Edward II. Edward III. also
  bore it for the first thirteen years of his reign, so that this simple
  but beautiful flag was the royal banner for over one hundred and fifty
  years. Edward III., on his claim in the year 1340 to be King of France as
  well as of England, quartered the golden fleurs-de-lys of that kingdom
  with the lions of England.<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> This remained the Royal Standard
  throughout the rest of his long reign. Throughout the reign of Richard
  II. (1377 to 1399) the royal banner was divided in half by an upright
  line, all on the outer half being like that of Edward III., while the
  half next the staff was the golden cross and martlets on the blue ground,
  assigned to Edward the Confessor, his patron saint, as shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>. On the accession of Henry IV. to the throne, the
  cross and martlets disappeared, and he reverted to the simple quartering
  of France and England.</p>

  <p>Originally the fleurs-de-lys were scattered freely over the field,
  <i>semée</i> or sown, as it is termed heraldically, so that besides
  several in the centre that showed their complete form, others at the
  margin were more or less imperfect. On turning to Fig. <a
  href="#fig188">188</a>, an early French flag, we see this disposition of
  them very clearly. Charles V. of France in the year 1365 reduced the
  number to three, as in Fig. <a href="#fig184">184</a>, whereupon Henry
  IV. of England followed suit; his Royal Standard is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig22">22</a>. This remained the Royal Standard throughout the
  reigns of Henry V., Henry VI., Edward IV., Edward V., Richard III., Henry
  VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth&mdash;a period of two
  hundred years.</p>

  <p>On the accession of the House of Stuart, the flag was rearranged. Its
  first and fourth quarters were themselves quartered again, these small
  quarterings being the French fleur-de-lys and the English lions; while
  the second quarter was the lion of Scotland, and the third the Irish
  harp; the first appearance of either of these latter kingdoms in the
  Royal Standard. This form remained in use throughout the reigns of James
  I., Charles I., Charles II., and James II. The last semblance of dominion
  in France had long <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum" title="046.png"
  ><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>since passed away, but it will be seen
  that alike on coinage, arms, and Standard the fiction was preserved, and
  Londoners may see at Whitehall the statue still standing of James II.,
  bearing on its pedestal the inscription&mdash;"<i>Jacobus secundus Dei
  Gratia Angliæ, Scotiæ, Franciæ et Hiberniæ Rex</i>."</p>

  <p>During the Protectorate, both the Union Flag and the Standard
  underwent several modifications, but the form that the personal Standard
  of Cromwell finally assumed may be seen in Fig. <a href="#fig83">83</a>,
  where the Cross of St. George for England, St. Andrew for Scotland, and
  the harp for Ireland, symbolise the three kingdoms, while over all, on a
  shield, are placed the personal arms of the Protector&mdash;a silver lion
  rampant on a sable field.</p>

  <p>William III., on his landing in England, displayed a standard which
  varied in many respects from those of his royal predecessors, since it
  contained not only the arms themselves, but these were represented as
  displayed on an escutcheon, surmounted by the crown, and supported on
  either side by the lion and unicorn. Above all this was the inscription
  "For the Protestant Religion and the Liberties of England,"<a
  name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> while beneath it was "je
  maintiendray." The arms on the shield are too complex for adequate
  description without the aid of a diagram; suffice it to say that in
  addition to the insignia of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France, were
  eight others dealing with the devices of smaller Continental possessions
  appertaining to the new monarch. When matters had settled down and his
  throne was assured, the aggressive inscription, etc., disappeared, and
  the Royal Standard of William and his Consort Mary, the daughter of King
  James, reverted to the form used by the Stuart Sovereigns, plus in the
  centre a small escutcheon bearing the arms of Nassau, these being a
  golden lion rampant, surrounded by golden billets, upon a shield of
  azure.</p>

  <p>The Royal Standard of Queen Anne bore the devices of England,
  Scotland, Ireland, and France. On the accession of George I. the arms of
  Hanover were added, and from 1714 to 1801 the flag was as shown in Fig.
  <a href="#fig43">43</a>. The flag of Anne was very similar to this, only
  instead of Hanover in the fourth quarter, the arms of England and
  Scotland, as we see them in the first quarter, were simply repeated in
  the fourth.</p>

  <p>The Hanoverian quarter, Fig. <a href="#fig43">43</a>, was made up as
  follows:&mdash;The two lions on the red field are the device of
  Brunswick; the blue lion rampant, surrounded by the red hearts, is the
  device of Lunenburg; the galloping white horse is for Saxony; and over
  all is the golden crown of Charlemagne as an indication of the claim set
  up of being the successor of that potent Sovereign. The horse <!-- Page
  36 --><span class="pagenum" title="047.png"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>of Saxony is said to have been borne sable
  by the early kings, previous to the conversion to Christianity of
  Witekind, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 785. Verstigan, however, tells us
  that the ensign of Hengist at the time of the invasion of England by the
  Saxons was a leaping white horse on a red ground. The white horse is
  still the county badge for Kent. The flag, as we see it in Fig. <a
  href="#fig43">43</a>, was that of George I. and George II., and remained
  in use until the forty-second year of the reign of George III.</p>

  <p>On January 2nd, 1801, the Fleurs-de-lys of France were at length
  removed, and the flag had its four quarters as follows:&mdash;First and
  fourth England, second Scotland, and third Ireland; the arms of Hanover
  being placed on a shield in the centre of the flag. This remained the
  Royal Standard during the rest of the reign of George III., and
  throughout the reigns of George IV. and William IV. On the accession of
  Victoria the operation of the Salique law severed the connexion of
  Hanover with England, and the present Royal Standard is as shown in Fig.
  <a href="#fig44">44</a>, being in its arrangement similar to that of
  George IV. and William IV., except that the small central shield, bearing
  the arms of Hanover, is now removed.<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We turn now to the National Flag. As the feudal constitution of the
  fighting force passed away, the use of private banners disappeared, and
  men, instead of coming to the field as the retainers of some great
  nobleman and fighting under his leadership and beneath his flag, were
  welded into a national army under the direct command of the king and such
  leaders as he might appoint. The days when a great noble could change the
  fortunes of the day by withdrawing his vassals or transferring himself
  and them, on the eve of the fight, to the opposing party, were over, and
  men fought no longer in the interests of Warwick or of Percy, but in the
  cause of England and beneath the banner of St. George, the national
  Patron Saint.</p>

  <p>At the siege of Antioch, according to Robertus Monachus, a Benedictine
  of Rheims who flourished about the year 1120, and wrote a history of the
  Crusade, "Our Souldiers being wearied with the long continuance of the
  Battaile, and seeing that the number of enemies decreased not, began to
  faint; when suddenly an infinite number of Heavenly Souldiers all in
  white descended from the Mountains, the Standard-bearer and leaders of
  them being Saint George, Saint Maurice, and Saint Demetrius, which when
  the Bishop of Le Puy first beheld he cryed aloud unto his troopes, 'There
  are they (saith he) the succours which in the name of God I promised to
  you.' The issue of the miracle was this, that presently the enemies did
  turne their backs and lost the field: these being slaine, 100,000 horse,
  beside foot innumerable, and in their trenches such infinite store of
  victuals and munition found that served not only to refresh the wearied
  Christians, but to confound the enemy." This great victory at Antioch led
  to the recovery of Jerusalem. At the Crusades England, Arragon, and
  Portugal all assumed St. George as their patron saint.</p>

  <p>Throughout the Middle Ages the war-cry of the English was the name of
  this patron saint. "The blyssed and holy Martyr Saynt George is patron of
  this realme of Englande, and the crye of men of warre," we read in the
  "Golden Legend," and readers of Shakespeare will readily recall
  illustrations. Thus in "King Richard II." we read<span

  <p>or again in "King Henry V." where the king at the siege of Harfleur
  cries,</p>

  <p>At the battle of Poitiers, September 19th, 1356, upon the advance of
  the English, the Constable of France threw himself, Lingard tells us,
  across their path with the battle shout, "Mountjoy, St. Denis," which was
  at once answered by "St. George, St. George," and in the onrush of the
  English the Duke and the greater part of his <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="049.png"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>followers
  were swept away, and in a few minutes slain. In an interesting old poem
  on the siege of Rouen in 1418, written by an eye-witness, we read that on
  the surrender of the city,</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>We have before us, as we write, "The story of that most blessed Saint
  and Souldier of Christ Jesus, St. George of Cappadocia," as detailed by
  Peter Heylyn, and published in 1633, and the temptation to quote at
  length from it is great, as it is full of most interesting matter, but
  into the history of St. George space forbids us to go at any length. The
  author of the "Seven Champions of Christendom" makes St. George to be
  born of English parentage at Coventry, but for this there is no authority
  whatever, and all other writers make Cappadocia his birthplace. The
  history of St. George is more obscure than that of any name of equal
  eminence in the Calendar. According to the "Acta Sanctorum" he was the
  son of noble parents, became famous as a soldier, and, embracing
  Christianity, was tortured to death at Nicomedia in the year 303.</p>

  <p>In 1245, on St. George's Day, Frederic of Austria instituted an order
  of knighthood and placed it under the guardianship of the soldier-saint,
  and its white banner, bearing the ruddy cross, floated in battle
  alongside that of the Empire. In like manner on St. George's Day, in the
  year 1350, Edward III. of England instituted the order of the Garter with
  great solemnity. <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum" title="050.png"><a

  <p>St. George's Day, April 23rd, has too long been suffered to pass
  almost unregarded. The annual festivals of St. Andrew, St. Patrick, and
  St. David are never overlooked by the members of the various
  nationalities, and it seems distinctly a thing to be regretted that the
  Englishman should allow the name day of his Patron Saint to pass
  unnoticed.<a name="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Whatever
  conduces to the recognition of national life is valuable, and anything
  that reminds Englishmen of their common ties and common duties&mdash;and
  reminds them, too, of their glorious heritage in the past&mdash;should
  scarcely be allowed to fall into disuse. Butler, in his "Lives of the
  Fathers and Martyrs," tell us that at the great National Council, held at
  Oxford in 1222, it was commanded that the Feast of St. George should be
  kept. In the year 1415, by the Constitutions of Archbishop Chichely, St.
  George's Day was made one of the greater feasts and ordered to be
  observed the same as Christmas Day. In 1545 a special collect, epistle,
  and gospel were prepared, and at the Reformation, when many of the
  Saints' Days were swept away, this was preserved with all honour, and it
  was not till the sixth year of the reign of Edward VI., when another
  revision was made, that in "The Catalogue of such Festivals as are to be
  Observed" St. George's day was omitted.</p>

  <p>The Cross of St. George was worn as a badge,<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> over the armour, by every English
  soldier in the fourteenth and subsequent centuries, even if the custom
  did not prevail at a much earlier period. The following extract from the
  ordinances made for the government of the army with which Richard II.
  invaded Scotland in 1386, is a good illustration of this, wherein it is
  ordered "that everi man of what estate, condicion, or nation thei be of,
  so that he be of owre partie, here a signe of the armes of Saint George,
  large, bothe before and behynde, upon parell that yf he be slayne or

  same token or crosse of Saint George, notwithstandyng if he be prisoner,
  upon payne of deth." It was the flag of battle, and we see it represented
  in the old prints and illuminations that deal with military operations
  both on land and sea. Ordinarily it is the Cross of St. George, pure and
  simple, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, while at <!-- Page 40
  --><span class="pagenum" title="051.png"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>other times, as in Figs. <a
  href="#fig66">66</a>, <a href="#fig67">67</a>, <a href="#fig68">68</a>,
  it forms a portion only of the flag. The red cross on the white field was
  the flag under which the great seamen of Elizabeth's reign traded,
  explored, or fought; the flag that Drake bore round the world&mdash;that
  Frobisher unfolded amidst the Arctic solitudes&mdash;that gallant
  Englishmen, the wide world over, bore at the call of duty and died
  beneath, if need be, for the honour of the old home land; and to this day
  the flag of the English Admiral is the same simple and beautiful device,
  and the white ensign of the British Navy, Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a>,
  is similar, except that it bears, in addition, the Union; while the Union
  flag itself, Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>, bears conspicuously the ruddy
  cross of the warrior Saint.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a>, <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <a
  href="#fig74">74</a> and <a href="#fig140">140</a> are all sea-pennants
  bearing the Cross of St. George. The first of these is from a painting of
  H.M.S. <i>Tiger</i>, painted by Van de Velde, while Fig. <a
  href="#fig27">27</a> is flying from one of the ships represented in the
  picture by Volpe of the embarkation of Henry VIII. from Dover on his way
  to the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Fig. <a href="#fig74">74</a> is from a
  picture of H.M.S. <i>Lion</i>, engaging the French ship
  <i>Elisabethe</i>, on July 9th, 1745, the latter being fitted out to
  escort the Young Pretender to Scotland. Though the red, white, and blue
  stripes suggest the French tricolor, their employment in the pennant has,
  of course, no reference to France. The <i>Lion</i> had at the foremast
  the plain red streamer seen at Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>. Fig. <a
  href="#fig140">140</a> is the pennant flown at the present day by all
  Colonial armed vessels, while the pennant of the Royal Navy is purely
  white, with the exception of the Cross of St. George. In a picture by Van
  de Velde, the property of the Queen, representing a sea fight on August
  11th, 1673, between the English, French, and Dutch, we see some of the
  vessels with streamers similar to Fig. <a href="#fig140">140</a>, thus
  ante-dating the Colonial flag by over two hundred years.</p>

  <p>As we have at the present time the white ensign, Fig. <a
  href="#fig95">95</a>, the special flag of the Royal Navy; the blue
  ensign, Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>, the distinguishing flag of the
  Royal Naval Reserve; and the red ensign, Fig. <a href="#fig97">97</a>,
  the flag of the Merchant Service, each with the Union in the upper corner
  next the mast, so in earlier days we find the white flag, Fig. <a
  href="#fig65">65</a>, the red flag, Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>, and the
  blue, each having in the upper corner the Cross of St. George. Fig. <a
  href="#fig69">69</a> becomes, by the addition of the blue, a curious
  modification of Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>. It is from a sea piece of
  the sixteenth century. It was displayed at the poop of a vessel, while
  Fig. <a href="#fig79">79</a> is the Jack on the bowsprit.</p>

  <p>A hundred years ago or so, we may see that there was a considerable
  variety in the flags borne by our men-o'-war. Such galleries as those at
  Hampton Court or Greenwich afford many examples of this in the pictures
  there displayed. In a picture of a battle off Dominica, on April 12th,
  1782, we find, one of the English <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum" title="052.png"
  ><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>ships has two great square flags on the
  foremast, the upper one being plain red, and the lower one half blue and
  half white in horizontal stripes, while the main mast is surmounted by
  the Cross of St. George, and below it a tricolor of red, white, and blue
  in horizontal stripes. Other ships show equally curious variations,
  though we need not stop to detail them, except that in one case both fore
  and mizen masts are surmounted by plain red flags. In a picture of
  Rodney's Action off Cape St. Vincent, on January 16th, 1780, we meet with
  all these flags again. In the representation of an action between an
  English and French fleet on May 3rd, 1747, off Cape Finisterre, we notice
  that the English ships have a blue ensign at the poop, and one of them
  has a great plain blue flag at the foremast, and a great plain red flag
  at the main-mast head. In a picture of the taking of Portobello, November
  21st, 1739, we notice the same thing again. These plain surfaces of blue
  or red are very curious. It will naturally occur to the reader that these
  are signal flags, but anyone seeing the pictures would scarcely continue
  to hold that view, as their large size precludes the idea. In the picture
  of H.M.S. <i>Tiger</i> that we have already referred to, the flag with
  five red stripes that we have represented in Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>
  is at the poop, while from the bow is hoisted a flag of four stripes, and
  from the three mastheads are flags, having three red stripes. These
  striped red and white flags may often be seen.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most extraordinary grouping of flags may be seen in a
  picture of a naval review in the reign of George I. It was on exhibition
  at the Great Naval Exhibition at Chelsea, and is in private ownership.
  All the vessels are dressed in immense flags, and these are of the most
  varied description. It must be borne in mind that these are government
  bunting, not the irresponsible vagaries of private eccentricity. Besides
  the reasonable and orthodox flags, such as those represented in Figs. <a
  href="#fig65">65</a>, <a href="#fig66">66</a>, and others of equal
  propriety, we find one striped all over in red, white, blue, red, white,
  blue, in six horizontal stripes. Another, with a yellow cross on a white
  ground; a third, a white eagle on a blue field; another, a red flag
  inscribed&mdash;"For the Protestant Religion and the Liberty of England";
  while another is like Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, only instead of
  having a red cross on white, it has a blue one instead. An altogether
  strange assortment.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#fig67">67</a>, <a href="#fig68">68</a>, <a
  href="#fig72">72</a>, and <a href="#fig78">78</a> are flags of the London
  Trained Bands of the year 1643. The different regiments were known by the
  colour of their flags, thus Fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a> is the flag of
  the blue regiment, Fig. <a href="#fig68">68</a> of the yellow, Fig. <a
  href="#fig72">72</a> of the green, and Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a> of
  the yellow regiment auxiliaries. Other flags were as
  follows:&mdash;white, with red lozenges; green, with golden wavy rays;
  orange, with white trefoils; in each case the Cross of St. George being
  in the canton. <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum" title="053.png"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>In a list before us of the Edinburgh Trained
  Bands for 1685 we find that the different bodies are similarly
  distinguished by colours.<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the union of the two crowns at the accession of James VI. of
  Scotland and I. of England to the English throne, the Cross of St.
  Andrew, Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>, was combined with that of St.
  George.</p>

  <p>The Cross of St. Andrew has been held in the same high esteem north of
  the Tweed that the Southrons have bestowed on the ensign of St. George.
  It will be seen that it is shaped like the letter X. Tradition hath it
  that the Saint, deeming it far too great an honour to be crucified as was
  his Lord, gained from his persecutors the concession of this variation.
  It is legendarily asserted that this form of cross appeared in the sky to
  Achaius, King of the Scots, the night before a great battle with
  Athelstane, and, being victorious, he went barefoot to the church of St.
  Andrew, and vowed to adopt his cross as the national device. The sacred
  monogram that replaced the Roman eagles under Constantine, the cross on
  the flag of Denmark, the visions of Joan of Arc, and many other suchlike
  illustrations, readily occur to one's mind as indicative of the natural
  desire to see the potent aid of Heaven visibly manifested in
  justification of earthly ambitions, or a celestial support and
  encouragement in time of national discomfiture.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#fig75">75</a> and <a href="#fig76">76</a> are examples
  of the Scottish red and blue ensigns. The first of these is from a
  picture at Hampton Court, where a large Scottish warship is represented
  as having a flag of this character at the main, and smaller but similar
  colours at the other mastheads and on the bowsprit.</p>

  <p>The famous banner, the historic "blue blanket," borne by the Scots in
  the Crusades, was on its return deposited over the altar of St. Eloi in
  St. Giles' Church, Edinburgh, and the queen of James II., we read,
  painted on its field of azure the white Cross of St. Andrew, the crown,
  and the thistle. St. Eloi was the patron saint of blacksmiths, and this
  craft was made the guardian of the flag, and it became the symbol of the
  associated trades of ancient Edinburgh. King James VI., when venting his
  indignation against his too independent subjects, exclaimed, "The
  craftsmen think we should be contented with their work, and if in
  anything they be controlled, then up goes the blue blanket." The
  craftsmen were as independent and difficult to manage as the London
  Trained Bands often proved, but King James VI. found it expedient to
  confirm them in <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum" title="054.png"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>all their privileges, and ordered that the
  flag should at all times be known as the Standard of the Crafts, and
  later Sovereigns found it impossible to take away these privileges when
  they had once been granted. This flag was borne at Flodden Field. Beside
  the cross, crown, and thistle it bore on a scroll on the upper part of
  the flag the inscription, "Fear God and honor the king with a long lyffe
  and prosperous reigne," and on the lower portion the words, "And we that
  is trades shall ever pray to be faithfull for the defence of his Sacred
  Majesties' persone till deathe," an inscription that scarcely seems to
  harmonise with the turbulent spirit that scandalised this sovereign so
  greatly.</p>

  <p>The flags borne by the Covenanters in their struggle for liberty
  varied much in their details, but in the great majority of cases bore
  upon them the Cross of St. Andrew, often accompanied by the thistle, and
  in most cases by some form of inscription. Several of these are still
  extant. In one that was borne at Bothwell Brig, and now preserved in the
  Museum of the Society of Antiquaries, Edinburgh, the four blue triangles
  (see Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a> for these) are filled with the words,
  "For Religion&mdash;&mdash;Couenants&mdash;&mdash;King&mdash;&mdash;and
  Kingdomes." The Avondale flag was a white one, having the cross, white on
  blue, as in Fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>, in the corner. On the field of
  the flag was the inscription, "Avondale for Religion, Covenant, and
  King,"<a name="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> and beneath this
  a thistle worked in the national green and crimson. A very interesting
  Exhibition of Scottish national memorials was held at Glasgow in 1888,
  and many of these old Covenant flags were there displayed. At the great
  Heraldic Exhibition held in Edinburgh in 1891, one of the most
  interesting things shown was the Cavers Standard. This is of sage green
  silk, twelve feet by three. It bears the Cross of St. Andrew next the
  staff, and divers other devices are scattered over the rest of the flag.
  It is in excellent preservation, and its special interest lies in the
  fact that it is said to have been the standard of James, second Earl of
  Douglas and Mar, and borne by his son at the battle of Otterburn in the
  year 1388. If this be so it is one of the oldest flags in existence.</p>

  <p>On the signet-ring of Mary Queen of Scots the white Cross of St.
  Andrew is not shown on its usual blue ground, but on a ground striped
  blue and yellow, the royal colours; in the same way that the St. George's
  Cross is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>, not on a <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum" title="055.png"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>white ground, but on a ground striped white
  and green, the Tudor colours.</p>

  <p>Why St. Andrew was selected to be the Patron Saint of Scotland has
  never been satisfactorily settled.<a name="NtA_30"
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Some uncharitable enquirer has hazarded
  the explanation that it was because it was this Apostle who discovered
  the lad who had the loaves and fishes. Others tell us that one Hungus, a
  Pictish prince, dreamt that the Saint was to be his champion in a fight
  just then pending with the men of Northumbria, and that a cross&mdash;the
  symbol of the crucifixion of this Apostle&mdash;appeared in the sky, the
  celestial omen strengthening the hearts and arms of the men of Hungus to
  such effect that the Northumbrians were completely routed. Should neither
  of these explanations appear sufficiently explanatory, we can offer yet a
  third. On the martyrdom of St. Andrew, in the year 69, at Patræ, in
  Achaia, his remains were carefully preserved as relics, but in the year
  370, Regulus, one of the Greek monks who had them in their keeping, was
  warned in a vision that the Emperor Constantine was proposing to
  translate these remains to Constantinople, and that he must at once visit
  the shrine and remove thence an arm bone, three fingers of the right
  hand, and a tooth, and carry them away over sea to the west. Regulus was
  much troubled at the vision, but hastened to obey it, so putting the
  relics into a chest he set sail with some half-dozen other ecclesiastics,
  to whom he confided the celestial instructions that he had received.
  After a stormy voyage the vessel was at last dashed upon a rock, and
  Regulus and his companions landed on an unknown shore, and found
  themselves in a dense and gloomy forest. Here they were presently
  discovered by the aborigines, whose leader listened to their story and
  gave them land on which to build a church for the glory of God and the
  enshrining of the relics. This inhospitable shore proved to be that of
  "Caledonia, stern and wild," and the little forest church and hamlet that
  sprang up around it were the nucleus that thence and to the present day
  have been known as St. Andrews, a thriving, busy town in Fife, and for
  centuries the seat of a bishopric. On July 5th, 1318, Robert the Bruce
  repaired hither and testified his gratitude to God for the victory
  vouchsafed to the Scots at Bannockburn by the intercession of St. Andrew,
  guardian of the realm, when thirty thousand Scots defeated one hundred
  thousand Englishmen. What St. George could have been doing to allow this,
  seems a very legitimate question, but we can scarcely wonder that the
  Scots should very gladly appoint so potent a protector their patron, and
  look to him for succour in all their national difficulties.</p>

  <p>On the blending of the two kingdoms into one under the <!-- Page 45
  --><span class="pagenum" title="056.png"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>sovereignty of King James,<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> it became necessary to devise a new
  flag that should typify this union and blend together the emblems of the
  puissant St. George and the no less honoured St. Andrew, and the flag
  represented in Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a> was the result&mdash;the flag
  of the United Kingdoms of England and Scotland, henceforth to be known as
  Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The Royal Ordinance<a name="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
  ran as follows:&mdash;"Whereas some difference hath arisen between our
  subjects of South and North Britain, travelling by seas, about the
  bearing of their flags,&mdash;for the avoiding of all such contentions
  hereafter we have, with the advice of our Council, ordered that from
  henceforth all our subjects of this isle and kingdom of Greater Britain,
  and the members thereof, shall bear in their maintop the Red Cross,
  commonly called St. George's Cross, and the White Cross, commonly called
  St. Andrew's Cross, joined together, according to a form made by our
  Heralds, and sent by us to our Admiral to be published to our said
  subjects: and in their fore-top our subjects of South Britain shall wear
  the Red Cross only, as they were wont, and our subjects of North Britain
  in their fore-top the White Cross only, as they were accustomed.
  Wherefore we will and command all our subjects to be comparable and
  obedient to this our order, and that from henceforth they do not use or
  bear their flags in any other sort, as they will answer the contrary at
  their peril."</p>

  <p>Such a proclamation was sorely needed, as there was much ill-will and
  jealousy between the sailors and others of the two nationalities, and the
  Union flag itself, when "our heralds" produced it, did not by any means
  please the North, and the right to carry in fore-top the St. Andrew's
  Cross pure and simple was a concession that failed to conciliate them.
  The great grievance was that, as we see in Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>,
  the Cross of St. George was placed in front of that of St. Andrew, and
  the Scottish Privy Council, in a letter dated Edinburgh, August 7th,
  1606, thus poured forth their feelings:&mdash;"Most sacred Soverayne, a
  greate nomber of the maisteris of the schippis of this your Majesties
  kingdome hes verie havelie complenit to your Majesties Counsell, that the

  and the Inglishe Croce, callit Sanct George, drawne through the Scottis
  Croce, which is thereby obscurit, and no token nor mark to be seene of
  the Scottis armes. This will breid some heit and miscontentment betwix
  your Majesties subjectis, and it is to be feirit that some inconvenientis
  sall fall oute betwix thame, for our seyfaring men cannot be inducit to

  presentid to the Counsell, and craved our approbation of the same, but we
  haif reserved that to your Majestie's princelie determinatioun, as moir

  and to whom we haif remittit the discourse and delyverie of that mater,
  will informe your Majestie and let your Heynes see the errour of the
  first patrone and the indifferencie of the two newe drauchties." These
  draughts are not to be found, nor does it appear that any notice was
  taken of the complaint.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Union flag, as carefully depicted in a scarce little work
  published in 1701, and entitled "The Ensigns, Colours, and Flags of the
  Ships at Sea, belonging to the several Princes and States in the World,"
  may be seen in Fig. <a href="#fig88">88</a>. In it will be noted that the
  Cross of St. Andrew is placed in front of that of St. George&mdash;anyone
  comparing Figs. <a href="#fig73">73</a> and <a href="#fig88">88</a> will
  readily see wherein they differ. Though its appearance in a book of
  sea-flags would seem to imply that such a flag had been made, we know of
  no other instance of it. Fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a> was also suggested
  as a solution of the problem, but here we get false heraldry, the blue in
  contact with the red, and in any case a rather weak-looking
  arrangement.</p>

  <p>The painful truth is that when two persons ride the same animal they
  cannot both be in front, and no amount of heraldic ingenuity will make
  two devices on a flag to be of equal value. The position next the staff
  is accounted more honourable than that remote from it, and the upper
  portion of the flag is more honourable than the lower.<a name="NtA_33"
  href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> At first sight it might appear that
  matters are impartially dealt out in Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>, but
  the position next the staff is given to St. George, and in the quartered
  arrangement, Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>, the same holds true. Both
  these were suggestions made at the time the difficulty was felt, but both
  were discarded in favour of the arrangement shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig73">73</a>.</p>

  <p>This Union Flag is not very often met with. It occurrs on one of the
  great seals of Charles II., and is seen also as a Jack on the <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum" title="058.png"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>bowsprits of ships in paintings of early
  naval battles. It may, by good fortune, be seen also on the two colours
  of the 82nd regiment that in the year 1783 were suspended in St. Giles',
  Edinburgh, and a very good illustration of it may be seen in the National
  Gallery, where, in a battle scene by Copley, representing the death of
  Major Peirson, at St. Helier, Jersey, on January 6th, 1781, this Union
  flag is conspicuous in the centre of the picture. We have it again in Fig
  <a href="#fig57">57</a>, the original flag of the East India Company; the
  difference between this and the second Union Flag, made on the admission
  of Ireland's Cross of St. Patrick, may be very well seen on a comparison
  of Figs. <a href="#fig57">57</a> and <a href="#fig61">61</a>. We have it
  again in Figs. <a href="#fig142">142</a> and <a href="#fig143">143</a>,
  flags of the revolting American Colonists before they had thrown off all
  allegiance to the Old Country.</p>

  <p>A knowledge of the history of the flag has not only interest, but is
  of some little importance. We remember seeing a picture of the sailing of
  the <i>Mayflower</i>, in which, by a curious lack of a little technical
  knowledge, the flag depicted was the Union Flag of to-day, which did not
  come into existence until the first year of the present century, whereas
  the historic event represented in the picture took place in the year
  1620. In a fresco in the House of Lords, representing Charles II. landing
  in England,<a name="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> the artist
  has introduced a boat bearing the present Union Flag. In each of these
  cases it is evident that it should have been the first Union&mdash;that
  of England and Scotland&mdash;that the flag should have testified to.</p>

  <p>Charles I. issued a proclamation on May 5th, 1634, forbidding any but
  the Royal ships to carry the Union flag; all merchantmen, according to
  their nationality, being required to show either the Cross of St. George
  or that of St. Andrew. Queen Anne, on July 28th, 1707, required that
  merchant vessels should fly a red flag "with a Union Jack described in a
  canton at the upper corner thereof, next the staff," while the Union
  Flag, as before, was reserved for the Royal Navy. This merchant flag, if
  we cut out the inscription there shown, would be similar to Fig. <a
  href="#fig142">142</a>. This is interesting, because, after many changes,
  so lately as October 18th, 1864, it was ordered that the red ensign once
  again should be the distinguishing flag of the commercial marine; the
  present flag is given in Fig. <a href="#fig97">97</a>. It is further
  interesting because this proclamation of Queen Anne's is the first time
  that the term Union Jack, so far as we are aware, is officially used.</p>

  <p>Technically, our national banner should be called the Union Flag,
  though in ordinary parlance it is always called the Union Jack. <!-- Page
  48 --><span class="pagenum" title="059.png"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>The latter flag is a diminutive of the
  former, and the term ought in strictness to be confined to the small
  Union Flag flown from the Jack-staff on the bowsprit of a ship. The Union
  Flag is, besides this, only used as the special distinguishing flag of an
  Admiral of the Fleet, when it is hoisted at the main top-gallant
  mast-head, and when the Sovereign is on board a vessel, in which case the
  Royal Standard is flown at the main and the Union at the mizen. With a
  white border round it, as in Fig. <a href="#fig104">104</a>, it is the
  signal for a pilot: hence this is called the Pilot Jack. The sea flags
  now in use are the white, red, and blue ensigns, Figs. <a
  href="#fig95">95</a>, <a href="#fig96">96</a>, <a href="#fig97">97</a>,
  to be hereafter described, while the Union flag is devoted especially to
  land service, being hoisted on fortresses and government offices, and
  borne by the troops.</p>

  <p>Why the flag should be called "Jack" at all has been the subject of
  much controversy. It is ordinarily suggested that the derivation is from
  Jacques, the French word for James, the Union Jack springing into
  existence under his auspices. Why it should be given this French name
  does not seem very clear, except that many of the terms used in blazonry
  are French in their origin. It never seems to have been suggested that,
  granting the reference to King James, the Latin Jacobus would be a more
  appropriate explanation, as the Latin names of our kings have for
  centuries supplanted the earlier Norman-French on their coins, seals, and
  documents. Several other theories have been broached, of varying degrees
  of improbability; one of these deriving it from the word "jaque"<a
  name="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> (hence our modern
  jacket), the surcoat worn over the armour in mediæval days. This, we have
  seen, had the Cross of St. George always represented on it; but there is
  no proof that the jaque was ever worn with the union of the two crosses
  upon it, so that the derivation breaks down just at the critical point.
  The present flag came into existence in the reign of King George, but no
  one ever dreams on this account, or any other, of calling it the Union
  George.</p>

  <p>On the death of Charles I., the partnership between England and
  Scotland was dissolved, and the Union Flag, Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>,
  therefore, was disestablished, and was only restored in the general
  Restoration, when the Commonwealth and Protectorate had run their course,
  and Charles II. ascended the throne of his forefathers.</p>

  <p>The earliest Commonwealth Flag was a simple reversion to the Cross of
  St. George, Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>. At a meeting of the Council of
  State, held on February 22nd, 1648-49, it was "ordered that the ships at
  sea in service of the State shall onely beare the red Crosse <!-- Page 49
  --><span class="pagenum" title="060.png"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>in a white flag. That the engravings upon
  the Sterne of ye ships shall be the Armes of England and Ireland in two
  Scutcheons, as is used in the Seals, and that a warrant be issued to ye
  Commissioners of ye Navy to see it put in execution with all speed." The
  communication thus ordered to be made to the Commissioners was in form a
  letter from the President of the Council as follows:&mdash;"To ye
  Commissioners of ye Navy.&mdash;Gentlemen,&mdash;There hath beene a
  report made to the Councell by Sir Henry Mildmay of your desire to be
  informed what is to be borne in the flaggs of those Ships that are in the
  Service of the State, and what to be upon the Sterne in lieu of the Armes
  formerly thus engraven. Upon the consideration of the Councell whereof,
  the Councell have resolved that they shall beare the Red Crosse only in a
  white flagg, quite through the flagg. And that upon the Sterne of the
  Shipps there shall be the Red Crosse in one Escotcheon, and the Harpe in
  one other, being the Armes of England and Ireland, both Escotcheons
  joyned according to the pattern herewith sent unto you. And you are to
  take care that these Flaggs may be provided with all expedition for the
  Shipps for the Summer Guard, and that these engraveings may also be
  altered according to this direction with all possible
  expedition.&mdash;Signed in ye name and by order of ye Councell of State
  appointed by Authority of Parliament.&mdash;Ol. Cromwell, Derby House,
  February 23rd, 1648."</p>

  <p>In a Council meeting held on March 5th, considerably within a month of
  the one we have just referred to, it is "ordered that the Flagg that is
  to be borne by the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admiral be that now
  presented, viz., the Armes of England and Ireland in two severall
  Escotcheons in a Red Flagg, within a compartment."<a name="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> This arrangement may be seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig82">82</a>. A Commonwealth flag that is still preserved at the
  dockyard, Chatham, differs slightly from this. The ground of the flag is
  red, but the shields are placed directly upon it without any intervening
  gold border, and around them is placed a large wreath of palm and laurel
  in dark green colour.</p>

  <p>In the year 1787 an interesting book called the "Respublica" was
  published; the author, Sir John Prestwich, deriving much of his material
  from MSS. left by an ancestor of his who lived during the Interregnum. In
  this the reader may find full descriptions of many of the flags of the
  Parliamentarians. One of these is much like the Chatham example already
  referred to, except that the ground of the flag is blue, and that outside
  the shields, but within the wreath, is found the
  inscription&mdash;"<i>Floreat Respublica.</i>" <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="061.png"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span></p>

  <p>The flag of the Commonwealth was borne to victory at Dunbar,
  Worcester, and many another hard-fought field, and under its folds Blake,
  Monk, and other gallant leaders gained glorious victories over the Dutch
  and Spaniards, and made the English name feared in every sea.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Of wind's and water's rage they fearful be,</p>
      <p>But much more fearful are your flags to see.</p>

      <p>More wish'd for and more welcome is than sleep,</p>
      <p>They dreaded to behold, lest the sun's light</p>
      <p>With English streamers should salute their sight."<a name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It was not until the year 1651 that Scotland was brought under the
  sway of the Commonwealth, and the ordinance for its full union with
  England and Ireland was not promulgated until April 12th, 1654. Somewhat
  later an Order of Council recognised the new necessities of the case, and
  decreed that the Standard for the Protectorate be as shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig83">83</a>. England and Scotland are here represented by their
  respective crosses, while Ireland, instead of having the Cross of St.
  Patrick, is represented by the harp. In Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a> all
  three crosses are introduced, but there seems somewhat too much white in
  this latter flag for an altogether successful effect, and the blue of the
  Irish quarter, balancing the blue of the Scottish, is more pleasing. The
  Union Flag underwent yet another modification, and instead of being like
  Figs. <a href="#fig82">82</a> or <a href="#fig86">86</a>, the Union Flag
  of James I., Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>, was reverted to, and in the
  centre of the flag was placed a golden harp&mdash;"the Armes of England
  and Scotland united, according to the anncient form, with the addicion of
  the harpe." On the restoration of Charles II. this harp was removed, and
  Ireland does not appear again in the Union Flag, Fig. <a
  href="#fig73">73</a>, until January 1st, 1801.</p>

  <p>A pattern farthing of this period&mdash;preserved in the magnificent
  numismatic collection in the British Museum&mdash;shows on its reverse a
  three-masted ship: at the stern is a large flag divided vertically, like
  Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a>, into two compartments, the Cross of St.
  George in one and the harp in the other; the main and mizen masts are
  shown with flags containing St. George's Cross only, as in Fig. <a
  href="#fig91">91</a>, while the foremast bears a flag with St. Andrew's
  Cross upon it, a flag similar to Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>.</p>

  <p>For nearly fifty years before its rise, and for nearly one hundred and
  fifty years after the downfall of the Protectorate, that is to say from
  1602 to 1649 and from 1659 to 1801, the Union Flag was as shown in Fig.
  <a href="#fig73">73</a>, but in 1801 the Legislative Union of Ireland
  with Great Britain was effected, and a new Union Flag, the one now in
  <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum" title="062.png"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>use, was devised. This may be seen in Fig.
  <a href="#fig90">90</a>, the noblest flag that flies under heaven.</p>

  <p>Though the National Flag is primarily just so much silk or bunting,
  its design and colouring are full of meaning: and though its prime cost
  may be but a few shillings, its value is priceless, for the national
  honour is enwrapped in its folds, and the history of centuries is figured
  in the symbolism of its devices. It represents to us all that patriotism
  means. It is the flag of freedom and of the greatest empire that the
  world has ever known. Over three hundred millions of people&mdash;in
  quiet English shires, amid Canadian snows, on the torrid plains of
  Hindustan, amidst the busy energy of the great Australian group of
  colonies, or the tropical luxuriance of our West Indian
  possessions&mdash;are to-day enjoying liberty and peace beneath its
  shelter. Countless thousands have freely given their lives to preserve
  its blazonry unstained from dishonour and defeat, and it rests with us
  now to keep the glorious record as unsullied as of old; never to unfurl
  our Union Flag in needless strife, but, when once given to the breeze, to
  emulate the deeds of our forefathers, and to inscribe on its folds fresh
  records of duty nobly done.</p>

  <p>How the form known as St. Patrick's Cross, Fig. <a
  href="#fig93">93</a>, became associated with that worthy is not by any
  means clear. It is not found amongst the emblems of Saints, and its use
  is in defiance of all ecclesiastical tradition and custom, as St. Patrick
  never in the martyrological sense had a cross at all, for though he
  endured much persecution he was not actually called upon to lay down his
  life for the Faith. It has been suggested, and with much appearance of
  probability, that the X-like form of cross, both of the Irish and of the
  Scotch, is derived from the sacred monogram on the Labarum of
  Constantine, where the X is the first letter of the Greek word for
  Christ. This symbolic meaning of the form might readily be adopted in the
  early Irish Church, and thence be carried by missionaries to
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>A life of St. Patrick was written by Probus, who lived in the seventh
  century, and another by Jocelin, a Cistercian monk of the twelfth
  century, and this latter quotes freely from four other lives of the Saint
  that were written by his disciples.</p>

  <p>St. Patrick was born in Scotland, near where Glasgow now stands. The
  date of his birth was somewhere near the close of the fourth century, but
  as to the year authorities differ widely&mdash;372, 455, 464, and 493
  being all given by various biographers.<a name="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> His father was of good family, and,
  while the future saint was still under the paternal roof, God manifested
  to him by divers visions that he was <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="063.png"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>destined
  for the great work of the conversion of Ireland, at that time plunged in
  idolatry. Hence he resigned his birthright and social position, and
  devoted himself entirely to the salvation of these barbarians, suffering
  at their hands and for their sakes much persecution. He was ordained
  deacon and priest, and was ultimately made a bishop. He travelled over
  the whole of Ireland founding monasteries and filling the country with
  churches and schools of piety and learning. Animated by a spirit of
  perfect charity and humility, he demonstrated not only the faith but the
  spirit of his Master, and the result of his forty years of labour was to
  change Ireland from a land of barbarism into a seat of learning and
  piety, so that it received the title of the Island of Saints, and was for
  centuries a land of mental and spiritual light.</p>

  <p>On the Union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with Ireland in the year
  1801, the following notice was issued by Royal
  Authority:&mdash;"Proclamation, George R.&mdash;Whereas by the First
  Article of the Articles of Great Britain and Ireland it was declared:
  That the said Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland should upon this day,
  being the First Day of January, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand
  Eight Hundred and One, for ever after be united into One Kingdom, by the
  name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: and that the
  Royal Style and Titles appertaining to the Imperial Crown of the said
  United Kingdom and its Dependencies, and also the Ensigns Armorial,
  Flags, and Banners thereof, should be such as We, by our Royal
  Proclamation under the Great Seal of the said United Kingdom should
  appoint: We have thought fit, by and with the advice of our Privy
  Council, to appoint and declare that our Royal Style and Titles shall
  henceforth be accepted, taken, and used as the same set forth in Manner
  and Form following: Georgius Tertius, Dei Gratia, Britannarium Rex, Fidei
  Defensor; and in the English Tongue by these words: George the Third, by
  the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King,
  Defender of the Faith; and that the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the said
  United Kingdom shall be Quarterly: first and fourth, England: second,
  Scotland: third, Ireland: and it is Our Will and Pleasure that there
  shall be borne thereon on an escutcheon of pretence, the Arms of Our
  Domains in Germany, ensigned with the Electoral Bonnet:<a name="NtA_39"
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> And that the Union Flag shall be Azure,
  the Crosses Saltire of St. Andrew and St. Patrick Quarterly, per Saltire
  counterchanged Argent and Gules: the latter fimbriated of the second,
  surmounted by the Cross of St. George of the third, fimbriated as the
  Saltire." <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum" title="064.png"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span></p>

  <p>The heralds who devised the new flag of the extended Union, Fig. <a
  href="#fig90">90</a>, have been subjected to a very considerable amount
  of adverse criticism,<a name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
  but no one has really been able to suggest a better plan than theirs. It
  will be noted in the illustration and in every Union flag that is made,
  that the red Cross of St. Patrick, Fig. <a href="#fig93">93</a>, is not
  in the centre of the white Cross, Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>, of St.
  Andrew. The scarlet Cross of St. George is equally fringed on either side
  by the white border or fimbriation that represents the original white
  field, Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, on which it was placed, and on the
  addition of the white cross or saltire of St. Andrew on its field of
  blue, Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>, it fitted in very happily. When,
  however, another X-like cross had to be provided for, on the admission of
  Ireland to the Union, a difficulty at once arose. As the Irish Cross
  would, according to all rule and fairness, be of the same width on the
  joint flag as that of St. Andrew, the result of placing the second or red
  X over the first white one would be to entirely obliterate the latter.
  Even then the Irish Cross would not be rightly rendered, as it should be
  on a white ground, and by this method it would be on a blue one, while if
  we placed the Irish Cross on that of St. Andrew, but left a thin line of
  white on either side, St. Andrew's Cross would still be obliterated, as
  the thin fimbriation of white would be the just due of St. Patrick, and
  would not stand for St. Andrew at all. Besides, Scottish indignation
  would not unjustly be aroused at the idea that their noble white cross
  should become a mere edging to the symbol of St. Patrick. Hence the
  somewhat awkward-looking compromise that breaks the continuity of
  direction of the arms of the red cross of Ireland by its portions being
  thrown out of the centre of the white oblique bands, so that in each
  portion the crosses of Ireland and Scotland are clearly distinguished
  from each other. This compromise notwithstanding, no more effective or
  beautiful flag unfolds itself the round world over than the Union flag of
  Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

  <p>The crosses might have been quartered as we see them in Fig. <a
  href="#fig80">80</a>, but it is clearly better to preserve the idea of
  the unity and blend all three crosses into one composition. No criticism
  or objection has ever come from Ireland as to the Union flag, but even so
  lately as 1853 the Scotch renewed their grievance against the Cross of
  St. Andrew being placed behind that of St. George, "and having a red
  stripe run through the arms thereof, for which there is no precedent in
  law or heraldry." If ever an Irishman cared to hunt up a grievance,
  surely here is one at last&mdash;the cross of his patron saint "a red
  stripe"! <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum" title="065.png"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

  <p>When the Union flag is flown, it should always be as we have drawn it
  in Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>, with the broad white stripe nearest to
  the head of the flagstaff. It would be quite possible, our readers will
  see, on a little study of the matter, to turn it with the red stripe
  uppermost; but this, as we have indicated, is incorrect; and, trivial as
  the matter may appear, there is a right and a wrong in it, and the point
  must not be overlooked.</p>

  <p>Many suggestions at the time of the Union were made by divers writers
  in the public prints, such as the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and the
  like. One version preserved the flag of the first Union, Fig. <a
  href="#fig73">73</a>, but placed in the centre a large green circle
  having within it the golden harp of the Emerald Isle; but this is
  objectionable, as it brings green on red, which is heraldically false,
  and as Ireland has a cross as well as England and Scotland, it seems more
  reasonable to keep the whole arrangement in harmony. Another version, and
  by no means a bad one, is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig89">89</a>, where
  each cross is distinct from the two others. This appeared in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for March 20th, 1803, and, like all the other
  suggestions, good, bad, and indifferent, suffered from the fatal
  objection that it saw the light when the whole matter was already settled
  and any alteration scarcely possible.</p>

  <p>In view of the changes from the simple Cross of St. George to its
  union later on with that of St. Andrew, and later on still the union of
  both with that of St. Patrick, it is sufficiently evident that Campbell's
  stirring appeal to the mariners of England to defend the flag that for a
  thousand years has braved the battle and the breeze, however excellent in
  spirit, does not fit in with the literal facts, though we would not
  willingly change it for such a version as</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ye mariners of England,</p>
      <p class="i2">That guard our native seas:</p>
      <p>Whose flag has braved since eighteen-one,</p>
      <p class="i2">The battle and the breeze.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The "Queen's Regulations" are very precise as to the hoisting of the
  flag at the various home and foreign stations and fortresses. Some few of
  these have the Royal Standard for use on Royal Anniversaries and State
  occasions only, and these flags are issued in two sizes&mdash;either
  twenty-four by twelve feet, or twelve by six feet&mdash;according to the
  importance of the position; thus Dover, Plymouth, and the Tower of
  London, for example, have the larger size. In like manner the Union Flag
  is of two sizes: twelve by six feet, or six by three feet. These flags at
  the various stations are either hoisted on anniversaries only, or on
  Sundays in addition, or else daily; thus Dover, besides its Standard, has
  a Union flag, twelve by six, for special occasions, and another, six by
  three, <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum" title="066.png"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>which is hoisted daily. Our foreign
  stations, Bermuda, Cape of Good Hope, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Hong Kong,
  Halifax, St. Helena, and so forth, are all equally rigidly provided for
  in Regulations. There is no option anywhere in the matter. A particular
  fortress has to fly a particular flag of a particular size on a
  particular day.</p>

  <p>The white ensign, Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a>, is the distinguishing
  flag of the Royal Navy. It is hoisted at the peak of all vessels in
  commission, or in such other conspicuous position of honour as their rig
  or (as in the case of some ironclads) absence of rig will permit. It is a
  large white flag, having upon it the Cross of St. George, the portion of
  the flag nearest the mast-head being occupied by the Union.<a
  name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Until 1864 the Royal Navy was divided into the white, the blue, and
  the red squadrons, distinguished by the flags shown in Figs. <a
  href="#fig95">95</a>, <a href="#fig96">96</a>, and <a
  href="#fig97">97</a>, but this arrangement, though it had lasted for over
  two hundred years,<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> was
  found to have many inconveniences. It was very puzzling to foreigners,
  and it was necessary that each vessel should have three sets of colours,
  so as to be able to hoist the orthodox flag for the squadron in which,
  for the time being, it might be placed. It was also a difficulty that
  peaceful merchantmen were carrying a red ensign, Fig. <a
  href="#fig97">97</a>, exactly similar to the war flag of the vessels of
  the red squadron. It was inconvenient in action, too; hence, Nelson at
  Trafalgar ordered the whole of his fleet to hoist the white ensign. An
  Order of Council, dated October 18th, 1864, put an end to this use of
  differing flags, declaring that henceforth the white ensign alone should
  be the flag of the Royal Navy. In the old days the red was the highest,
  the white the intermediate, and the blue the third in rank and
  dignity.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty's ships, when at anchor in home ports and roads, hoist
  their colours at 8 o'clock in the morning from March 25th to September
  20th, and the rest of the year an hour later; and on foreign stations, at
  either of these hours as the commanding officer shall direct; and either
  abroad or at home they remain flying throughout the day until sunset.<a
  name="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> When at sea, on passing,
  meeting, <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum" title="067.png"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>joining or parting from any other of Her
  Majesty's ships or on falling in with any other ship the flag is hoisted,
  and also when in sight of land, and especially when passing any fort,
  battery, lighthouse, or town.</p>

  <p>When salutes are fired on the occasion of a foreign national festival,
  such as the birthday of the sovereign, the flag of the nation in question
  is hoisted at the main during the salute and for such further time as the
  war ships of such nation are be-flagged, but if none are present, then
  their flag remains up till sunset. Should a British war vessel arrive at
  any foreign fortified port, the flag of the foreign nation is hoisted at
  the main during the exchange of salutes.</p>

  <p>It is a rank offence for any vessel to fly any ensign or pendant
  similar to those used in the Royal Navy. It will at once be boarded by
  any officer of Her Majesty's Service, the offending colours seized, and
  the vessel reported. The penalty for the offence is a very heavy one.</p>

  <p>The admiral has as a flag the white flag with the Cross of St. George
  thereon, Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, and this must be displayed at the
  main top-gallant mast-head, since both the vice and rear-admirals are
  entitled to fly a similar flag, but the former of these displays his from
  the fore, and the latter from the mizen top-gallant mast-head; it being
  not the flag alone but the position of it that is distinctive of rank.
  The commodore's broad pendant is a very similar flag, but it tapers
  slightly, and is swallow-tailed.</p>

  <p>The "Naval Discipline Act," better known as "The Articles of War,"
  commences with the true and noble words&mdash;"It is on the Navy, under
  the Good Providence of God, that our Wealth, Prosperity, and Peace
  depend," and we may trust that the glorious traditions of this great
  service may be maintained to the full as effectually under the White
  Ensign as in any former period for the defence of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,</p>
      <p>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</p>

  </div>

  <p>The blue ensign, Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>, is the flag of the
  Royal Naval Reserve, and may be flown by any merchant vessels that comply
  with the <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum" title="068.png"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>Admiralty conditions respecting that
  service. Such vessels must be commanded by officers of the Reserve, and
  at least one-third of their crew must belong to it: they then, the
  structural conditions being satisfactory, receive a Government subvention
  and an Admiralty Warrant to fly the blue ensign. Officers commanding Her
  Majesty's ships, meeting with ships carrying the blue ensign, are
  authorised to go on board them at any convenient opportunity and see that
  these conditions are strictly carried out, provided that they are of
  superior rank to the officers of the Royal Naval Reserve. The men of the
  Reserve receive an annual retainer and drill pay. The number of men in
  the Reserve, at the time we write these lines, is 10,600 in the first
  class and 10,800 in the second. The first class Reserve is composed of
  the men on the long voyage ships, the second being the fishermen and
  coasting crews. In addition to this there are some 3,000 engineers and
  stokers, and some 1,500 or so of officers, all equally prepared to rally
  to the pennant and to take their place in the national defence.</p>

  <p>This utilisation of the faster vessels of the Mercantile Marine as
  cruisers in war time has seriously engaged the attention of the
  Admiralty. The Government gives an annual subsidy, and then claims the
  right to the vessel at a fixed charge in case of emergency. Such vessels
  would be of immense service in time of war in many ways: for scouting,
  for transporting troops, and for engaging such of the enemy as she felt
  fairly a match for. When, some few years ago, it seemed as though war
  with Russia was imminent, the <i>Massilia</i> and the <i>Rosetta</i> of
  the Peninsula and Oriental Company's fleet were put in commission by
  telegraph at Sydney and Hong Kong respectively. These vessels were
  provided at once with warlike stores, and were at gun practice off the
  ports referred to a few hours after the receipt of instructions, and
  ready to go anywhere. This Company, during the Crimean War, carried over
  sixty thousand men to the scene of operations, and during the Indian
  Mutiny, the war in the Soudan, and all other possible occasions, has
  rendered the greatest aid to the State. The <i>Teutonic</i> and the

  <p>The Red Ensign, represented in Fig. <a href="#fig97">97</a>, is the
  special flag of the ordinary merchantman. "The Red Ensign"&mdash;lays
  down the "Merchant Shipping (Colours) Act"&mdash;"usually worn by
  merchant ships, without any defacement or modification whatsoever, is
  hereby declared to be the proper national colour of all ships and boats
  belonging to any subject of Her Majesty, except in the case of Her
  Majesty's ships or boats, or in the case of any other ship or boat for
  the time being allowed to wear any other national colours, in pursuant of
  a Warrant from Her Majesty or from the Admiralty."</p>

  <p>This Act goes on to say that any ship belonging to any subject of the
  Queen shall, on a signal being made to her by one of Her Majesty's ships,
  or on entering or leaving any foreign port, hoist the red ensign, and if
  of fifty tons gross tonnage or upwards, on entering or leaving any
  British port also, or incur a penalty not exceeding one hundred pounds. A
  merchantman may also fly the Union Jack from the bowsprit, but if so the
  flag, as in Fig. <a href="#fig104">104</a>, must have a broad white
  border.</p>

  <p>The earliest form of red ensign is seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig66">66</a>. In a picture at Hampton Court, representing the
  embarkation of William of Orange for England, in the year 1688, his ship
  is shown as wearing two flags, one a red one with St. George's Cross in
  the canton, as in Fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a>, while the other, also
  red, has the Union Flag in the canton. We get, therefore, a regular
  sequence of red ensigns: that with St. George's Cross alone in the corner
  next the masthead; that with the Union of St. George and St.
  Andrew&mdash;this picture at Hampton Court being the earliest example
  known of its use; and, thirdly, that of to-day with the crosses of St.
  George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick.</p>

  <p>Some little degree of flag-lore is valuable not only to the soldier,
  the seaman, or the traveller, but to everyone. For want of this
  knowledge, ludicrous and serious mistakes are often made. Discussing
  these matters with a man of good general knowledge, we found that he had
  a notion that there were two kinds of "Union Jack," one, that had most
  red in it, being the Army flag; while the other, in which blue
  preponderated, was the flag of the Navy! Outside a large provincial
  theatre we saw a conspicuous notice indicating that the piece then
  running was entitled "The Old Flag." To emphasise this was a picture of a
  square of British linesmen surrounded by <!-- Page 59 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="070.png"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>Zulus,
  while in the centre of the square rose the Royal Standard! As a set-off
  to this we saw, not far off, a public house called the "Royal Standard,"
  flying from its roof the white Ensign! A friend of ours brought home for
  his son a really capital toy model of an ironclad, with turrets, ram,
  fighting tops, etc., and yet flying the red ensign of the harmless
  merchantman!</p>

  <p>At a church we occasionally pass, the living being in the gift of the
  Queen, the Royal Standard is hoisted on such Church festivals as
  Christmas Day, while at other times, for no apparent reason, the white
  Ensign is substituted&mdash;the special flag of the War Navy. Anyone
  venturing to point out to the authorities thereof that, as the old church
  could scarcely take up its position as a unit in our fighting
  fleet&mdash;having, in fact, quite another mission in the world&mdash;the
  special flag of the Royal Navy was not the most appropriate, would
  probably derive from the interview the impression that, after all, to the
  churchwardens a flag was a flag, and that it was quite possible to make a
  mountain out of a molehill.</p>

  <p>To one who knows anything about it, the eruption of silk bunting, and
  baser fabrics innumerable that comes to the fore on any occasion of
  national rejoicing, is a thing of horror, not merely in the festal
  disfigurements of the patchwork counterpane or cotton pockethandkerchief
  type, seeing that to some people any coloured piece of stuff that will
  blow out in the wind is a valid decoration, but in the painful ignorance
  shown in the treatment of recognised ensigns. Some little time ago, for
  instance, we found ourselves in a town gaily beflagged and radiant in
  bunting on the occasion of a great popular rejoicing. The Royal Standard,
  betokening the presence in the house of some member of the Royal Family,
  was flying with a profusion that made it impossible to believe that all
  the people displaying it could be entertaining such distinguished guests.
  As a set-off, others were decking their houses with red flags, the
  symbols of revolution and bloodshed, or with yellow ones, leaving us to
  infer that such houses were to be avoided as nests of yellow fever or
  such-like deadly infection. The Stars and Stripes of the United States
  were, in almost every case, upside down, as indeed were many others; a
  thing that, except for the ignorance that was its excuse, might be
  considered as an insult to the various Foreign Powers, while the repeated
  reversal of the red ensign implied a signal of distress. The good folks
  really meant no harm to anybody, and they were quite happy to believe, as
  they strolled in their thousands up the leading streets of the town, that
  their decorations were a great success. At the same time, a little more
  knowledge would have done them no harm. As it is an insult to hoist one
  national flag below another, it is a rigid law that in all official
  decorations national flags may not be so placed, but <!-- Page 60
  --><span class="pagenum" title="071.png"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>enthusiastic and irresponsible burgesses, in
  the depth of their ignorance, ignore all such considerations of
  international courtesy, and in the length of a short street commit
  sufficient indiscretion to give umbrage to all mankind. It may be said
  that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Happiness too swiftly flies,</p>
      <p>Thought would destroy their Paradise"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>that "he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow," that</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"From ignorance our comfort flows,</p>
      <p>The only wretched are the wise"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>but despite all this philosophy, that "where ignorance is bliss 'tis
  folly to be wise," no one is the worse for knowing something about the
  matter with which he is dealing; and if proverbial philosophy is to count
  for anything in the matter, a not inappropriate moral may be quoted as to
  the rushing in of fools where their betters feel a judicious modesty. The
  confidence of knowledge is better than the confidence of ignorance, and
  would certainly, in street flagging, produce a more satisfactory
  result.</p>

  <p>We have in Plate VI. some few examples of these vagaries from sketches
  that we made at the time. Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>, if it had not got
  the Union in the canton, would nearly be the Danish flag, Fig. <a
  href="#fig225">225</a>, but the addition of the canton makes it sheer
  foolishness. Fig. <a href="#fig46">46</a> is a good example of the notion
  that anything will do if it be only bright enough: it is a mere piece of
  patchwork, not by any means the only one in evidence. Figs. <a
  href="#fig47">47</a> and <a href="#fig50">50</a> explain themselves; it
  is evident that in one case the decorator started with a white ensign and
  in the other with a blue one, and then, feeling that they were a little
  small and insignificant looking, tacked on a goodly amount of red
  material to bring them up to their notion of what would be sufficiently
  conspicuous in size. Fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a> is very quaint: there
  is a notion of the white ensign hovering about it, but the Royal Standard
  employed as a canton in one quarter is outside all the proprieties, and
  in any case all the arm of the cross that one would expect to see below
  the canton is absorbed by it. The addition of the two red tails to the
  Royal Standard in Fig. <a href="#fig49">49</a> is not by any means
  legitimate, while in Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a> the Royal Standard is
  made the canton of a red ensign, and, as if this were not bad enough in
  itself, the whole thing is flown upside down. Many of the so-called flags
  had no semblance to anything, some were strange and abnormal tricolors;
  others, chequers: one, we remember, was deep crimson, with a broad
  bordering round three of its edges of light blue. Whatever opportunity of
  going wrong seemed to be at all feasible appeared to be eagerly seized by
  some well-meaning burgess, so that the result was a perfect museum of
  examples of how not to do it, and therefore of immense interest.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having now dealt with the Union Flag and the Red and Blue Ensigns, we
  proceed to see how these are modified by the addition of various devices
  upon them.</p>

  <p>The flags of the army claim the first place in our regard. Each
  infantry regiment has two "colours," one being called the "Queen's
  Colour," and the other the "Regimental Colour." On turning to Barret's
  "Theorike and Practike of Modern Warres," a book published in the year
  1598, we find the following passage:&mdash;"We Englishmen do call them of
  late colours, by reason of the variety of colours they be made of,
  whereby they be the better noted and known." This we may doubtless accept
  as a sufficient explanation of the word, and the passage is interesting,
  too, as approximately fixing a date for the introduction of the term, and
  showing that it has been in use for at least three hundred years.</p>

  <p>The Queen's Colour in every regiment of the line is the flag of the
  Union, Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>, bearing in its centre the Imperial
  crown and the number of the regiment beneath it in Roman figures worked
  in gold, and its territorial designation.</p>

  <p>The regimental Colour is of the colour of the facings of the regiment,
  except when these are white, in which case the body of the flag is not
  plain white all over, but bears upon it the Cross of St. George. Whatever
  the colour, it bears in its upper corner the Union, and in the centre of
  the flag the crown and title of <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum" title="073.png"
  ><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>the regiment, and around it whatever
  devices, or badges, or other distinctions have been specially conferred
  upon it, together with the names of the actions in which the regiment has
  taken part, the records of its gallant service in many a hard-fought
  struggle in the Peninsula, on the sultry plains of India, beneath the
  burning sun of Africa, or wherever else the call of honour and of duty
  has added to its laurels. Thus the regimental flag of the 1st regiment of
  the line bears the proud record&mdash;St. Lucia, Egmont-op-Zee, Egypt,
  Corunna, Busaco, Salamanca, Vittoria, St. Sebastian, Nive, Peninsula,
  Niagara, Waterloo, Nagpore, Maheidpore, Ava, Alma, Inkermann, Sebastopol,
  and several other records of struggles in which they bore gallant share;
  and many another regiment could show as fine a record of service.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a> we have a representation of the
  regimental colour of the 24th Regiment. As the facings of this
  distinguished corps are green,<a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> the body of the flag is of that colour.
  Beneath its territorial designation will be seen its special badge, the
  Sphinx, bestowed upon it for distinguished service in Egypt, and around
  are grouped the names of famous victories which it contributed to
  win.</p>

  <p>The 24th Regiment, now in the territorial arrangement in vogue known
  as the 2nd Warwickshire, was first formed in the year 1689. In 1776 it
  embarked for Canada and greatly distinguished itself in the American
  struggle. In 1801 we find it in Egypt, where by its gallantry it won the
  right to bear the Sphinx.<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> From 1805 to 1810 it was fighting its
  way along at the Cape of Good Hope, and then went on to India. In 1829 we
  find it sent off to Canada again to suppress rebellion, and it did not
  return to England till 1841. In 1846 we see it in the thick of the
  Punjaub struggle, taking its part right well in the brilliant engagements
  of Chillianwallah and Goojerat, and in 1857 it is in the thick of the
  sanguinary Mutiny in India; and, after fifteen years in India, lands in
  1861 in England once more. In 1874 we find it again at the Cape of Good
  Hope, and in 1877-78 engaged in the Kaffir war, and in all times and in
  all places taking a gallant share in upholding the national cause.</p>

  <p>In 1804 a second battalion was added to the regiment. This only
  existed ten years, but in that time it earned by its distinguished <!--
  Page 63 --><span class="pagenum" title="074.png"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>bravery the names of the Peninsula battles
  for the flag,<a name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> and at
  the conclusion of the struggle it was so weak in numbers that it was
  disembodied. In 1858 a new second battalion was formed, and did good
  service in Burmah, South Africa, etc. Both battalions were in Zululand in
  1879, and with the exception of one hundred men detailed for special
  duty, the regiment, save nine men, was wiped out of existence in the
  fatal field of Isandhlwana. Lieutenants Melville and Coghill tore the
  colours from their staffs and wrapped them around their bodies, and after
  the fight was over and the enemy had retired they were recovered. On the
  arrival of the colours in England they were taken by Royal Command to
  Osborne, where the Queen fastened to each a wreath of immortelles, and
  bestowed on the two dead heroes the Victoria Cross as the highest
  acknowledgment then possible to her of her deep appreciation of the
  sacrifice that these young gallant officers had made for her, for
  England, and for the honour of the flag. The colours, therefore, that we
  have represented in Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a>, in all their broad
  blazon of gallant service, even in the hour of defeat never fell into the
  hands of the enemy, to be hung in triumph in some Zulu kraal, but were
  brought back in honour and proud rejoicing, since defeat so valiantly met
  was no disgrace, and the honour of the flag and of the gallant 24th was
  without stain.</p>

  <p>As one more illustration of regimental colours we may instance those
  of the 25th Regiment, the King's Own Borderers. Here the groundwork of
  the flag is blue, with, of course, the Union in the upper corner next the
  staff. In the centre of the flag is a representation of Edinburgh Castle,
  and within a band the words, "King's Own Borderers." Outside this we have
  a wreath of rose, shamrock, and thistle, surmounted by the crown. Below
  this is a sphinx for service in Egypt, and below this again the word
  "Martinique." On either side is inscribed "Minden" and "Egmont op Zee,"
  and above all, "Afghanistan." In the upper outer angle of the flag is the
  lion on the crown and the motto "<i>In veritate religionis confido</i>,"
  and in the lower outer angle the white horse of Hanover and the motto
  "<i>Nec aspera terrent</i>."<a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> This was originally known as the
  Edinburgh Regiment, as it was raised in four hours in 1689 to defend that
  city; but George III., for some reason more or less <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="075.png"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>satisfactory to himself, changed the name to
  the one it has ever since borne&mdash;the King's Own Borderers.</p>

  <p>In the year 1811 the Prince Regent, on behalf of the King, issued an
  order to regulate the colours of the Army, and, amongst other things,
  sanctioned the custom that had sprung up of inscribing the names of
  victories on the flags. The custom of inscribing these honours, the names
  of the actions fought, did not begin till the battle of Minden, so that
  the victories of Marlborough and all other glorious achievements prior to
  the year 1759 would have gone unrecorded; but in July, 1881, sanction was
  given for the Grenadiers and the 1st, 3rd, 8th, 10th, 15th, 16th, 18th,
  21st, 23rd, 24th, 26th, and 27th Regiments of the Line to add Blenheim
  and Ramilies to their colours. Oudenarde, Malplaquet, and Dettingen<a
  name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> were also added to the
  colours of those regiments that were there engaged.</p>

  <p>By the "Queen's Regulations" these colours are required to be of silk,
  and to be three feet nine inches in length and three feet in breadth; the
  cords and tassels are to be of mixed crimson and gold; the staff is to be
  eight feet seven inches long, and surmounted by a golden crown on which
  stands a lion. They are to be carried on parade by the two junior
  lieutenants, and guarded by two sergeants and two privates. These form
  what is called "the colour party." The distinguishing badge of the
  colour-sergeant consists of crossed colours, embroidered on the sleeve
  above the chevrons of his rank.</p>

  <p>It has taken something like a thousand years of time to build up the
  British Empire, while the lavish outlay of toil and forethought of
  statesmen, the ceaseless spending of blood and treasure, the brilliant
  strategy by land and sea of a long line of distinguished commanders have
  all contributed to its birth and proud maintenance; and of all this
  devotion in the past and the determination to uphold it in the future,
  the flag is the living concrete symbol. It is the flag beneath whose
  folds Nelson and Wellington and countless heroes more were carried to
  their rest; it waved in triumph on the Heights of Abraham, and its honour
  was safe with Elliot at Gibraltar; it was unfurled on many a battlefield
  in the Peninsula, and nerved the arms of those who scaled the heights of
  the Alma and stood unconquerable in the stubborn fight of Inkerman; and
  it waved triumphant in the breeze at Sebastopol. The sight of it was
  strength, comfort, and hope in the dark days of Lucknow and Cawnpore. It
  floated, a symbol of duty, over the heroes of the burning
  <i>Birkenhead</i>, and to Ross, Parry, Franklin and McClure, in the icy
  wastes of the far North it was an incentive to renewed <!-- Page 65
  --><span class="pagenum" title="076.png"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>effort and a symbol of home. It was the flag
  of Speke and Livingstone in savage Africa, of Burke and Wills in their
  explorations in Australia; and for the honour of England that it
  symbolises men have thought no sacrifice too great.</p>

  <p>The Queen's Colour is a pledge of loyalty to the Sovereign, an emblem
  of the unity of all, while the second colour deals with the honour that
  specially appertains to each regiment&mdash;a subject of legitimate pride
  in the past and an incentive to prove not unworthy in the future of those
  who gained it such distinction.</p>

  <p>For some recondite reason the Guards reverse the arrangement that
  holds in the Line regiments, as with them the Queen's Colour is crimson
  and bears the regimental devices and honours, while the Union Flag is the
  Regimental Colour. William IV., in 1832, gave the Grenadier Guards a
  special flag of crimson silk, bearing in its centre the royal cypher
  W.R., interlaced in gold, and having grouped together in the four corners
  the rose, thistle, and shamrock.</p>

  <p>The Governor-General in India issued in the year 1803 a general order
  that all the regiments engaged in Wellington's greatest Indian
  victory&mdash;Assaye&mdash;should be entitled to the special distinction
  of a third flag, and the Royal authority confirmed the honour. This flag,
  borne by the 74th Highlanders, the 78th or Ross-shire Buffs, and other
  distinguished regiments, was of white silk, having in its centre an
  elephant, beneath this the regimental number, and around it a wreath. On
  blue bands above and below were inscribed in gold the words Assaye and
  Seringapatam. In the year 1830 the general use on parade of these flags
  was discontinued by order, and they were reserved for very special
  occasions.</p>

  <p>The number of colours borne by the different regiments was formerly
  very irregular: sometimes it was one to a company, sometimes only one to
  a whole regiment, now it is two to each battalion. During the eighteenth
  century several regiments carried three colours, and the 5th, or
  Northumberland Fusiliers, continued to do so until 1833. By an
  unfortunate accident these were then all burnt, and when the question of
  granting new colours came forward, the right to carry the third was
  objected to, and the claim had to be surrendered. King Charles's Royal
  Regiment of Foot Guards lost eleven out of thirteen colours at
  Edgehill.</p>

  <p>The Standards carried by the Life Guards, Horse Guards, and Dragoon
  Guards are of crimson silk, thirty inches by twenty-seven; and the
  guidons of the dragoon regiments are forty-one inches by twenty-seven,
  are slit in the fly and have the outer corners rounded off. The tassels
  and cords are of crimson silk and gold, and each flag bears the Royal or
  other title of the regiment in letters of gold in a circle, and beneath
  it the number of the regiment, all being surmounted by the crown,
  surrounded by a <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum" title="077.png"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>wreath of rose, shamrock, and thistle, and
  the honours. Where a regiment has a particular badge, such device will be
  placed in the centre, and the territorial and numerical position placed
  outside; thus the Scots Greys (the 2nd Royal Dragoons) bear as their
  badge the Imperial Eagle of France, because at Waterloo this
  distinguished regiment captured the eagle of the French 45th Regiment, on
  which were inscribed the words Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, Eylau, and
  Friedland.<a name="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> The 3rd
  Dragoons have as their badge the white horse of Hanover, and, as record
  of good service, Salamanca, Vittoria, Toulouse, Peninsula, Cabool,
  Moodkee, Sobraon, Ferozeshah, Punjaub, Chillianwallah, Goojerat. The
  Lancers and Hussars, like the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, and
  the Rifle Brigade, have no colours, and therefore bear their badges,
  devices, etc., on their appointments. Thus, for instance, King George II.
  ordered the 17th Light Dragoons (now the 17th Lancers) to wear the device
  of the skull and cross-bones, and beneath it the words "or glory" on the
  front of their caps and on the left breast. This device the "Death or
  Glory Boys" still retain, like the famous Pomeranian Horse and the Black
  Brunswickers, continental corps from whom the Anglo-Hanoverian monarch
  doubtless derived the idea.<a name="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The presentation of colours to a regiment is always an imposing
  ceremony, as with prayer of consecration, martial music, and stirring
  address they are delivered into its custody, but the bestowal of the old
  colours in some honoured place of safe keeping is yet more impressive. In
  the one case there are the hopes and dangers of the future, while in the
  other the hopes have all been abundantly realised, the dangers
  triumphantly passed, as the tattered colours&mdash;storm tossed, torn by
  shot and shell&mdash;are borne in honour to their last resting place,
  where, strife for ever over, they rest in peace in the Sanctuary of God,
  a memorial to all men, until their last shreds fall to decay, of duty
  nobly and fully done.</p>

  <p>Visitors to Canterbury Cathedral will scarcely fail to have noticed
  the flags therein suspended. The colours of the 1st Battalion of the
  Buffs (the East Kent Regiment) there find fitting resting place, and the
  last of these were added so lately as October, 1892.<a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> On their entrance, with imposing

  <p>After a short service of prayer and praise the Dean of Canterbury
  addressed the great congregation. It might be asked, he said, why they,
  who were the Ministers of the Prince of Peace, should take such interest
  in these military proceedings. It was because they recognised in them the
  greatest force for peace that there was in our land, for it was through
  them that this country of ours had not been trampled for centuries under
  the feet of any foreign foe, it was through them that the <i>Pax
  Britannica</i> prevailed, and that everywhere where the British Flag was
  present it carried with it peace, and tranquillity, and justice. It was
  through the help of the army that the peaceful people of this country
  could carry on their avocations and serve God and do His work in peace;
  and therefore the clergy gratefully acknowledged their services, and
  hoped and prayed that everywhere the colours of each regiment might still
  be not only unstained, but covered with laurels in struggling for right
  and for justice.</p>

  <p>Colonel Hobson then addressed the vast audience, reminding the younger
  soldiers present that the regiment to which they had the honour to belong
  was formed more than three hundred years ago, and was, therefore, the
  oldest in the Army. It had won honour and renown in every part of the
  world, and the colours which they were that day appropriately laying to
  rest in the Warriors' Chapel of Canterbury Cathedral represented as
  glorious a record as that of any regiment in the British Army. The
  earliest existence of the regiment dated from the movement set on foot in
  this country in the latter half of the sixteenth century, to assist the
  cause of civil and religious liberty in the Netherlands. The dragon,
  which is on the colours, was the crest of the City of London, from whose
  Trained Bands the regiment was formed in 1572; and the regimental march,
  so familiar to them all, was given them by Queen Elizabeth. After
  enumerating some few of the services that the regiment had rendered, he
  concluded by saying:&mdash;"The few words I have still to say I want you
  young soldiers especially to listen to and to take to heart. The colours
  of a regiment are symbolical of what ought to be the watchword of an
  army&mdash;duty; the Queen's Colours&mdash;duty to <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="079.png"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>your
  Sovereign and to your country; the Regimental Colours&mdash;duty towards
  the regiment. In these days the material side of the profession of arms
  is much insisted upon, but I tell you that an army without something
  higher than that, however well cared for in other respects, is a bad
  army, and that when thoughtfulness and care for the good name of a
  regiment is sacrificed for selfish, individual advancement, the regiment,
  as a whole, will suffer. The spirit which animated the regiments of the
  British Army&mdash;who placed those names, of which we are so proud
  to-day, on those colours&mdash;was, duty first, self afterwards; and it
  will be a bad day for the British Army if that spirit is ever allowed to
  depart from it. There was no position in the army, however humble, in
  which men could not sustain the credit and honour of their regiment and
  thus contribute to their country's welfare."</p>

  <p>The Dean thereupon solemnly accepted the care of the colours and
  pronounced the Benediction, and the whole audience then joined heart and
  voice, with thrilling effect, in singing the National Anthem.</p>

  <p>It seems so natural to write of England and of Englishmen, so stilted
  to put Great Britain and Ireland, that one may possibly forget that,
  comprehensive as we intend the terms to be, we may, perhaps, wound the
  susceptibilities of our fellow subjects and brother Britons across the
  Tweed. Let us then turn to a companion picture, and see how, with equal
  honour and devotion, the flags of our gallant Highlanders are borne to
  their rest.</p>

  <p>A movement was, some time ago, set on foot to gather in the old flags
  from the various Scottish regiments and to place them all in the
  Cathedral Church of Edinburgh. This was effected, and the perspective
  effect of these, as they line the nave on either side, is very fine. The
  oldest colours there are those of the 82nd, the Duke of Hamilton's
  regiment, presented in the year 1782, and still in excellent
  preservation.</p>

  <p>When on November 14th, 1883, the old colours borne by the various
  Scottish regiments were deposited in St. Giles' Cathedral, they were
  escorted in all honour and military pomp from the Castle; and says one
  who was there: "When the colours came in sight, the multitude raised a
  shout and cheered, but the impulse was but momentary, for at sight of the
  array of shattered rags the noise of the tumult died away, and a
  half-suppressed sound was heard as through the hearts of the people there
  flashed a thrill of mingled pride and pain. Those who saw it will never
  forget the scene. In the centre the tattered silk of the Colours, and on
  the fringe and in the background a wonder-stricken crowd, as past
  uncovered heads, past dimmed eyes and quivering lips, the old flags were
  carried."</p>

  <p>When the flags had been received with service of prayer and <!-- Page
  69 --><span class="pagenum" title="080.png"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>praise, the meaning of it all was summed up
  in burning words of love, devotion, and pride. "We have gathered to-day,"
  said the speaker, "for a noble purpose&mdash;to receive with all honour
  into this national church these flags, which have been borne by our
  soldiers through many a hard fight and in many a distant land. 'In the
  name of the Lord,' said the inspired Psalmist long ago, 'we will set up
  our banners.' In the spirit in which he spoke, these banners were first
  unfurled; and in that great Name they were blessed by God's ministers ere
  they were committed to those who were to carry them, as a testimony that,
  as a nation, we believe in God, and desire that He should guide our
  destinies alike in war and in peace; and now, after the lapse of years,
  they are brought back to rest in God's house as a testimony to the same
  truth, that we acknowledge Him as the supreme source of all our national
  success and greatness. 'Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power,
  and the victory, and the majesty! Both riches and honour come of Thee,
  and in Thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all.' It
  is in this spirit that we place these emblems in Scotland's great
  historic church. The associations that gather around these faded banners
  are of the tenderest and most touching kind. They are such as cause the
  heart to swell and the tear to come to the eye. Few, I feel sure, in this
  vast assemblage have not felt in some degree their power. There are
  soldiers here whom they carry back to old days, and to comrades with whom
  they stood shoulder to shoulder in many a perilous hour. The old flag has
  for the British soldier a meaning so deep and powerful that it is
  impossible to put it into words. It is but a piece of silk, often faded
  and tattered, and rent with shot: but it is a symbol, and symbols are
  amongst the most sacred things on earth. It means for the soldier his
  Queen and his country, and all the honour, loyalty, truth, and heroism
  they demand of him. Therefore it is that men will follow their colours
  down into the dreadful pit, and would be willing to die twice for them
  rather than let them be taken by an enemy; and in the hour of defeat,
  like the heroes of Isandlwhana, will fall pierced through with wounds,
  but with these precious symbols, still untarnished, wrapped around them.
  And though to the peaceful citizen these emblems can never mean all they
  stand for to those who have served under them, even to him, as they hang
  here, they may speak of things that it is good for him to remember. They
  may well tell him of the history of his country, and the wonderful way by
  which God has led her, and of the brave men He has raised up to fight for
  her. Nor can we help specially remembering that these are the colours of
  our Scottish regiments. Scotland is a poor country compared to the great
  neighbour with whom it is happily united, but it possesses a distinct
  national life <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum" title="081.png"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>of its own which all true Scotchmen would
  not willingly let die. We are proud of our Scotch regiments. We feel that
  they, of the whole army, belong especially to ourselves; and they too, as
  they have swept on to battle with the cry, 'Scotland for ever!' feel, we
  believe, that they belong specially to us. Providence, said Napoleon
  sneeringly, is generally on the side of the strongest battalions. Be it
  so; but will anyone deny that the character of the soldier has much to do
  with the strength of the battalion they form? And was it not the
  character of our soldiers&mdash;a character fostered by the traditions of
  their native land, fostered still more, perhaps, by the religious
  teaching of their native church and parish school&mdash;that made them
  strong on many a memorable day, and never more than on that memorable day
  at Waterloo, when the great commander I have named generously exclaimed,
  as he saw his own ranks yielding before the onslaught, 'Les braves
  Ecossais!' May the sight of these banners inspire every soldier who looks
  on them, whether Lowland or Highland, to echo the desire to hand down the
  name they bear without a blemish! And should the day ever come when we as
  a people are tempted to succumb to sloth and luxury, first to undervalue,
  and finally to give up, national power and privileges which are an
  heritage from God, and have been dearly purchased by those who went
  before us&mdash;may these emblems, and the stirring memories that cling
  to them, help us in some degree to wake up the last drop of blood left in
  our hearts, and nerve us to bear ourselves like the children of our
  sires. 'We have heard with our ears, O God, and our fathers have told us,
  what Thou didst in their days in the times of old. For they got not the
  land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save
  them, but Thy right hand and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance,
  because Thou hadst a favour unto them. Through Thee will we push down our
  enemies; through Thy name will we tread them under that rise up against
  us.'" This impressive and imposing ceremony closed with the magnificent
  "Hallelujah Chorus" of Handel, and the final Benediction.</p>

  <p>That colours do not always perish in honour may be seen by the
  following extract from the <i>Scots' Magazine</i> of June, 1746, where
  the citizens of Edinburgh assisted at a very different function to the
  one we have just described. "Fourteen rebel colours," says the ancient
  newsman, "taken at Culloden, were brought into Edinburgh on the 31st May,
  and lodged in the castle. On Wednesday, the 4th of June, at noon, they
  were brought down to the Cross, the Pretender's own standard carried by
  the hangman, and the rest by chimney sweepers. The sheriffs, accompanied
  by the heralds, pursuivants, trumpeters, city constables, etc., and
  escorted by the city guard, walked to the Cross, where a proclamation was
  <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum" title="082.png"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>made that the colours belonging to the
  rebels were ordered by the Duke of Cumberland to be burnt by the hands of
  the common hangman. The Pretender's standard was then put on a fire that
  had been prepared, and afterwards all the rest one by one&mdash;a herald
  always proclaiming to whom each belonged, the trumpets sounding, and the
  populace, of which there was a great number assembled, huzzaing."</p>

  <p>Various government officials have their special flags. The flag of the
  Union having been established by "Queen's Regulations" for the naval
  service, as the distinguishing flag to be borne by the admiral of the
  fleet, great inconvenience arose from the use of the same flag when
  military authorities, diplomatic and consular agents were embarking in
  boats or other vessels; so it became necessary to make some modification
  in the flag. It is therefore now ordered that a general or other officer
  commanding a military station shall have, in the centre of the Union, a
  blue shield bearing the Royal initials, surmounted by a crown and
  surrounded by a garland; those in the diplomatic service shall have, in
  the centre of the Union, a white shield bearing the Royal Arms, and
  surrounded by a garland; while consuls-general, consuls, or consular
  agents have the Blue Ensign as their distinguishing flag, and in the
  centre thereof the Royal Arms. The flag of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland
  is the Union, and in its centre, as we may see in Fig. <a
  href="#fig106">106</a>, a blue shield bearing the golden harp.</p>

  <p>Different Government Departments have their special flags also. Thus
  the Transport Service has the blue ensign with a golden anchor, placed
  horizontally, in the fly, while the Victualling Department has the blue
  ensign again, but this time as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig98">98</a>,
  with two crossed anchors. On the blue ensign of the Board of Trade is
  found in the fly a white circle, and within this a ship in full sail (see
  Fig. <a href="#fig105">105</a>). The Ordnance Department flag,
  represented in Fig. <a href="#fig108">108</a>, bears a shield with
  cannons and cannon balls upon it, while vessels and boats employed on
  submarine mining service are authorized to carry the blue ensign
  with&mdash;as its special badge&mdash;a hand issuing from a mural crown,
  and grasping a thunderbolt. The Telegraph branch of the Post-Office has a
  very striking device: a representation of Father Time with his hour glass
  smashed by lightning. The red ensign is employed by the Custom House and
  the Excise, in the first case having, as we see in Fig. <a
  href="#fig107">107</a>, a golden crown in the fly, and, in the second, a
  crown and star. The flag of the Admiralty is a very striking one (Fig. <a
  href="#fig99">99</a>). This association of the anchor with the Admiralty
  is a very natural one; we see it not only in our English flag, but in
  those of France, Italy, Germany, Russia, etc. Our Admiralty flag is
  hoisted on any ship when the Commissioners <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="083.png"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>of the
  Admiralty are on board,<a name="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
  and it is also hoisted at the fore top-gallant mast of every ship on
  which the Queen may be on board. Vessels carrying Her Majesty's mail fly
  on the fore-mast a white burgee, having in its centre a crown, and on one
  side of it the word "Royal" and on the other "Mail"; the words Royal Mail
  and the crown being in red on the white field of the flag.</p>

  <p>The White Ensign, Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a>, the special flag of
  Her Majesty's Navy, is, by very exceptional privilege, allowed to be
  flown by the Royal Yacht Squadron. This distinction was conferred on that
  Club in the year 1829, the Club itself being established in 1812.<a
  name="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> In the old days, when the
  Royal Navy used the red, white, and blue ensigns, the red ensign was of
  the highest dignity; and it was this from 1821 to 1829 that the Royal
  Yacht Squadron flew, but, as the red ensign was also used by merchant
  vessels, they adopted in 1829 the white ensign as being more distinctive.
  In 1842 the Admiralty drew up a Minute that no warrant should be issued
  to any other yacht club to fly the white ensign, and that those
  privileged Clubs that already had it must henceforth forego it. Copies of
  the minute were accordingly sent to the Royal Western of England, Royal
  Thames, Royal Southern, and some two or three other clubs, but, by some
  oversight, the Royal Western of Ireland was overlooked, and that Club
  continued to use the white ensign until the mistake was discovered by the
  Admiralty in the year 1857. Since that date the Royal Yacht Squadron,
  which has always been under the special patronage of Royalty, has been
  alone in its use. Its value is purely sentimental; it carries no
  substantial privilege. A rather marked case arose, in fact, to the
  contrary in 1883, when Lord Annesley's yacht, the <i>Seabird</i>, was
  detained by the Turkish authorities at the Dardanelles in consequence of
  her bearing the white ensign. No foreign man-of-war is allowed to pass
  the Dardanelles without special permission; and the white <!-- Page 73
  --><span class="pagenum" title="084.png"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>ensign of the Royal Navy brought her within
  that category. On account of this, all yacht owners were warned that
  should they wish to pass the Dardanelles under the white or blue ensign,
  the latter being also the flag of the Royal Naval Reserve, they must
  first obtain an Imperial Iradé, otherwise they were recommended to
  display the red ensign. Austria-Hungary, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Sweden,
  Norway, and France have each, in like manner, given to the leading club
  of the country the privilege of flying the naval flag. In America and
  Russia a special ensign has been accorded to all yacht clubs, and all
  take equal rank. Some years ago the Royal Cork Yacht Club wished to adopt
  a green ensign, but the Admiralty refused to sanction a new colour.</p>

  <p>The Blue Ensign is conferred on certain Yacht Clubs by special
  Admiralty warrant. The Royal Eastern, Royal Barrow, Royal Clyde, Royal
  Highland, Royal Northern, Royal Western of England, Royal Cinque Ports,
  Royal Albert, Royal Dorset, etc., fly the Blue Ensign pure and simple;
  others have a distinguishing badge on the fly, thus the Royal Irish has a
  golden harp and crown, the Royal Ulster a white shield with the red hand,
  the Royal Cornwall the Prince of Wales' Feathers, the Royal Harwich a
  golden rampant lion, and so forth. The clubs flying the Red Ensign change
  it slightly from that flown by the Merchant Service; thus the Royal St.
  George, Royal Victoria, and Royal Portsmouth have a golden crown in the
  centre of the Union canton, while the Royal Yorkshire has a white rose
  and gold crown on the fly, and the Royal Dart a golden dart and crown.
  Each club has also its distinguishing burgee, and ordinarily of the same
  colour as its ensign; thus, though the Royal Clyde and the Royal Highland
  both fly the plain blue ensign, the Royal Clyde burgee has on it the
  yellow shield and red lion rampant, while the Royal Highland has the
  white cross of St. Andrew. Fig. <a href="#fig100">100</a> is the burgee
  of the Ranelagh Club, Fig. <a href="#fig101">101</a> of the Yare, Fig. <a
  href="#fig102">102</a> of the Royal Thames, Fig. <a
  href="#fig103">103</a> of the Dublin Bay Club.</p>

  <p>Besides these club ensigns and burgees, each yacht bears its owner's
  individual device, that is supposed to distinguish it from all others,
  though one finds, in looking through a series of such flags, that some of
  the simpler devices are borne by more than one yacht. Every yacht club
  has its special burgee, which is flown by each yacht in the club at her
  truck, but when the vessel is racing the individual flag takes its place.
  Many of these flags, though simple in character, are very effective and
  striking. The lower flags on Plate XII. are good typical examples. Fig.
  <a href="#fig121">121</a> is the yacht flag of His Royal Highness the
  Prince of Wales&mdash;the flag of the well-known <i>Britannia</i>; and
  Figs. <a href="#fig122">122</a> and <a href="#fig123">123</a> are those
  respectively of the equally-famed <i>Ailsa</i> and <i>Valkyrie</i>. <!--
  Page 74 --><span class="pagenum" title="085.png"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span></p>

  <p>Merchant vessels are permitted to adopt any House or Company flag on
  condition that it does not resemble any national flag. Its great use is
  that it should be clearly distinctive; and many of the flags employed are
  of strict heraldic propriety, and very attractive, while others are about
  as unsatisfactory and bald as they well could be. It would clearly be a
  painful and invidious thing to pick out any of these latter, so we can
  only suggest that any of our readers who have an opportunity of visiting
  busy ports, such as London, Southampton, Bristol, Liverpool, should
  collect their own awful examples and paint them in the margin of this
  page.</p>

  <p>We may point out, by the way, that anyone sketching flags would be
  greatly assisted by knowing the symbols for the various colours, as it
  may well be that anyone might have only a pencil in his pocket when
  desiring to make such a memorandum. White is expressed by simply leaving
  the paper plain, yellow by dotting the surface over, red by a series of
  upright lines, blue by horizontal lines, green by sloping lines, and
  black by a series of upright lines crossed by others at right angles to
  them. These are the colours used in books on heraldry, and they are very
  easily remembered. On some of our coins the colours of the arms in the
  shield are thus expressed, and on heraldic book-plates and the like they
  may be also seen&mdash;wherever, in fact, colour has to be expressed or
  notified without the actual use of it. Our readers will find that if they
  will sketch out in black and white some few of our examples they will
  soon gain a useful facility that may stand them in good stead whenever
  for this or any other purpose they want to make a colour memorandum, and
  have only a pencil or pen and ink to make it with.</p>

  <p>In the upper portion of Plate XII. we have several illustrations of
  Company flags. Fig. <a href="#fig109">109</a> is the well-known ensign of
  Green's Blackwall Line, while Fig. <a href="#fig110">110</a> is that of
  the Cunard. The Peninsular and Oriental flag (Fig. <a
  href="#fig111">111</a>) is divided by lines from corner to corner into
  four triangles, the upper one white, the lower yellow, the hoist blue,
  and the fly red. This division into triangles is a rather favourite one;
  we see it again in Fig. <a href="#fig112">112</a>, the Flag of the
  Australasian Steam Navigation Company. In the flag of the Demerara and
  Berbice Steamship Company the upper and lower portions are white, and the
  two side portions red; in the flag of the vessels belonging to Galbraith,
  Pembroke and Co., the upper is red, the lower blue, and the two sides
  white. In another company, that of Wesencraft of Newcastle, the colours
  are the same as the P. and O. flag, though differently placed, the blue
  being at the top, the red at the bottom, the yellow at the hoist, and the
  white at the fly. Fig. <a href="#fig113">113</a> is the flag of the fleet
  of Devitt and Moore, an Australian Line. Fig. <a href="#fig114">114</a>
  betokens the vessels of the <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum" title="086.png"
  ><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>Canadian Pacific Company, and Fig. <a
  href="#fig115">115</a> the ships of the Castle Line to South Africa. Fig.
  <a href="#fig116">116</a> is the Company flag of the Union Steamship
  Company, of Southampton, while Fig. <a href="#fig117">117</a> is the
  device of the Mediterranean and New York Steamship Company. Our remaining
  illustrations are; Fig. <a href="#fig118">118</a>, the flag adopted by
  Messrs. Houlden Brothers; Fig. <a href="#fig119">119</a>, that of the
  popular White Star Line; and Fig. <a href="#fig120">120</a>, that of the
  New Zealand Shipping Company. The well-known Allan Line has as its house
  flag the three upright strips of blue, white, and red that we see in the
  French tricolor, Fig. <a href="#fig191">191</a>, plus a plain red burgee
  that is always hoisted immediately above it. The Allan is the largest
  private ship-owning company in the world; in the course of the year there
  are some two hundred arrivals and departures of their vessels at or from
  Glasgow, and some fifty thousand people are carried annually to or from
  America. During the Crimean War many of the steamers of this line were
  chartered by the French Government for the transport of their troops, and
  it is in memory of this that the vessels of the Allan fleet adopt the
  tricolor as their house flag.</p>

  <p>That we have by no means exhausted this portion of our subject is
  patent from the fact that in a book before us that is specially devoted
  to these house flags seven hundred and eighty-two examples are given,
  wherein we find not only stripes, crosses, and such-like simple
  arrangements, but crescents, stars, anchors, lions, stags, thistles,
  castles, bells, keys, crowns, tridents, and many other forms.</p>

  <p>In earlier days merchant ships flew rather the flag of their port than
  of their nation, so that a vessel was known to be of Plymouth,
  Marseilles, Dantzic, or Bremen by the colours displayed. Thus the flag of
  Marseilles was blue with a white cross upon it; Texel, a flag divided
  horizontally into two equal strips, the upper being green and the lower
  black; Rotterdam was indicated by a flag having six horizontal green
  stripes upon it, the interspaces being white; Cherbourg, blue, white,
  blue, white, horizontally arranged; Riga, a yellow cross on a blue
  ground.</p>

  <p>The British Empire&mdash;the Greater Britain across the seas, some
  eighty times larger in area than the home islands of its birth&mdash;must
  now engage our attention. Its material greatness is amazing, far
  exceeding that of any other empire the world has ever seen, and its moral
  greatness is equal to its material. Wherever the flag of Britain flies,
  there is settled law, property is protected, religion is free; it is no
  mere symbol of violence or rapine, or even of conquest. It is what it is
  because it represents everywhere peace, and civilization, and commerce.
  Protected by the <i>Pax Britannica</i> dwell four hundred millions out of
  every race under heaven, the <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum" title="087.png"
  ><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>Mother of Nations extending to Jew,
  Parsee, Arab, Chinese, Blackfoot, Maori, the liberties that were won at
  Runnymead and in many another stern fight for life and freedom. In every
  school-room in the United States hangs the flag of their Union, the Stars
  and Stripes; and devotion to all that it symbolises is an essential part
  of the teaching. We in turn might well in our systems of education give a
  larger space to the history, laws, and literature of our great Empire,
  taking a more comprehensive view than is now ordinarily the case,
  studying the growth of the mighty States that have sprung into existence
  through British energy, and attaching at least as much importance to the
  lives of the men who have built up this goodly heritage as to the
  culinary shortcomings of Alfred or the schemes of Perkin Warbeck.</p>

  <p>As regards the value of our Colonies to the Empire, the following
  extract from a speech made by the Prince of Wales at the Royal Colonial
  Institute may very aptly be quoted<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"We regard the Colonies as integral parts of the Empire, and our
  warmest sympathies are with our brethren beyond the seas, who are no less
  dear to us than if they dwelt in Surrey or Kent. Mutual interests, as
  well as ties of affection, unite us as one people, and so long as we hold
  together we are unassailable from without. From a commercial point of
  view, the Colonies and India are among the best customers for home
  manufacturers, it being computed that no less than one-third of the total
  exports are absorbed by them. They offer happy and prosperous homes to
  thousands who are unable to gain a livelihood within the narrow limits of
  these islands, owing to the pressure of over-population and consequent
  over-competition. In transplanting themselves to our own Colonies,
  instead of to foreign lands, they retain their privileges as citizens of
  this great Empire, and live under the same flag as subjects of the same
  Sovereign. As Professor Seeley remarks in his very interesting work, 'The
  Expansion of England,' 'Englishmen in all parts of the world remember
  that they are of one blood and one religion; that they have one history,
  and one language and literature.' We are, in fact, a vast English nation,
  and we should take great care not to allow the emigrants who have gone
  forth from among us to imagine that they have in the slightest degree
  ceased to belong to the same community as ourselves."</p>

  <p>Our statesmen and thinkers have never failed to recognise the
  brotherhood of Greater Britain. Of this fact it would be easy enough to
  reproduce illustrations by the score. We need, however, here but refer to
  the sentiments of the Earl of Rosebery on the expansion of the Empire,
  where we find him declaring&mdash; <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum" title="088.png"

  <p>"Since 1868 the Empire has been growing by leaps and bounds. That is,
  perhaps, not a process which everybody witnesses with unmixed
  satisfaction. It is not always viewed with unmixed satisfaction in
  circles outside these islands. There are two schools who view with some
  apprehension the growth of our Empire. The first is composed of those
  nations who, coming somewhat late into the field, find that Great Britain
  has some of the best plots already marked out. To those nations I will
  say that they must remember that our Colonies were taken&mdash;to use a
  well-known expression&mdash;at prairie value, and that we have made them
  what they are. We may claim that whatever lands other nations may have
  touched and rejected, and we have cultivated and improved, are fairly
  parts of our Empire, which we may claim to possess by an indisputable
  title. But there is another ground on which the extension of our Empire
  is greatly attacked, and the attack comes from a quarter nearer home. It
  is said that our Empire is already large enough, and does not need
  extension. That would be true enough if the world were elastic, but,
  unfortunately, it is not elastic, and we are engaged at the present
  moment, in the language of mining, in 'pegging out claims for the
  future.' We have to consider not what we want now, but what we shall want
  in the future. We have to consider what countries must be developed,
  either by ourselves or some other nation, and we have to remember that it
  is part of our responsibility and heritage to take care that the world,
  as far as it can be moulded by us, shall receive an 'English-speaking'
  complexion, and not that of another nation. We have to look forward
  beyond the chatter of platforms, and the passions of party, to the future
  of the race of which we are at present the trustees, and we should, in my
  opinion, grossly fail in the task that has been laid upon us did we
  shrink from responsibilities, and decline to take our share in a
  partition of the world which we have not forced on, but which has been
  forced upon us."</p>

  <p>Statistics of area of square miles, population, and so forth, can be
  readily found by those who care to seek for them, and we need give them
  no place here; but let us at least try and realise just by bare
  enumeration something of what this Greater Britain is. In Europe it
  includes, besides the home islands, Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus. In
  Asia&mdash;the great Indian Empire, Ceylon, Aden, Hong-Kong, North
  Borneo, the Straits Settlements, Perim, Socotra, Labuan. In
  America&mdash;the Dominion of Canada, Newfoundland, Trinidad, Guiana,
  Honduras, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Bermudas, Barbadoes, Falkland Isles, the
  Leeward and Windward Isles. In Australasia&mdash;New South Wales,
  Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, New Zealand, Fiji, New
  Guinea. In Africa&mdash;the Cape Colony, Basutoland, Bechuanaland,
  Zululand, Natal, <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum" title="089.png"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>Gold Coast, Lagos, Sierra Leone, Gambia,
  Mauritius, Seychelles, Ascension, St. Helena. Our list is by no means a
  complete one.</p>

  <p>Newfoundland was the earliest British colony, the settlement being
  made about the year 1500. Many of our colonies have been thus created by
  peaceful settlement, while others have fallen to us in victorious fights
  with France, Holland, Spain, and other Powers, or have been ceded by
  treaty.</p>

  <p>The flags of our colonies are those of the Empire, with, in some
  cases, special modifications. In all our colonies, for instance, the
  Royal Standard, as we see it in England, is displayed on the fortresses
  on the anniversaries of the birth and coronation of the Sovereign.</p>

  <p>The Blue Ensign is the flag borne by any vessel maintained by any
  colony under the clauses of the Colonial Defence Act, 28 Vic., Cap. 14.
  The "Queen's Regulations" state that "Any vessel provided and used, under
  the third section of the said Act, shall wear the Blue Ensign, with the
  seal or badge of the Colony in the fly thereof, and a blue pendant. All
  vessels belonging to, or permanently in the service of, the Colony, but
  not commissioned as vessels of war under the Act referred to, shall wear
  a similar blue ensign, but not the pendant." In Figs. <a
  href="#fig127">127</a>, <a href="#fig128">128</a>, <a
  href="#fig130">130</a>, and <a href="#fig135">135</a> we have the
  Government Ensigns of four of our great Colonies&mdash;Cape Colony,
  Queensland, Canada, and Victoria&mdash;while in Fig. <a
  href="#fig140">140</a> we have the blue pendant.</p>

  <p>This Colonial Defence Act of 1865 is so important in its bearings on
  the possibilities of Naval defence that it seems well to quote from it
  some of its provisions. Its object is to enable the several Colonial
  possessions of Her Majesty to make better provision for Naval defence,
  and, to that end, to provide and man vessels of war; and also to raise a
  volunteer force to form part of the Royal Naval Reserve, to be available
  for the general defence of the Colony in case of need. This Act declares
  that "in any Colony it shall be lawful for the proper Legislative
  Authority, with the Approval of Her Majesty in Council, from Time to Time
  to make Provision for effecting at the Expense of the Colony all or any
  of the Purposes following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For providing, maintaining, and using a Vessel or Vessels of War,
  subject to such Conditions and for such Purposes as Her Majesty in
  Council from Time to Time approves.</p>

  <p>"For raising and maintaining Seamen and others entered on the Terms of
  being bound to serve as ordered in any such Vessel. <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="090.png"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span></p>

  <p>"For raising and maintaining a Body of Volunteers entered on the Terms
  of being bound to general Service in the Royal Navy in Emergency, and, if
  in any Case the proper Legislative Authority so directs, on the further
  Terms of being bound to serve as ordered in any such Vessel as
  aforesaid:</p>

  <p>"For appointing Commissioned, Warrant, and other Officers to train and
  command or serve as Officers with any such Men ashore or afloat, on such
  Terms and subject to such Regulations as Her Majesty in Council from Time
  to Time approves:</p>

  <p>"For obtaining from the Admiralty the Services of Commissioned,
  Warrant, and other Officers and of Men of the Royal Navy for the
  last-mentioned Purposes:</p>

  <p>"For enforcing good Order and Discipline among the Men and Officers
  aforesaid while ashore or afloat within the Limits of the Colony:</p>

  <p>"For making the Men and Officers aforesaid, while ashore or afloat
  within the Limits of the Colony or elsewhere, subject to all Enactments
  and Regulations for the Time being in force for the Discipline of the
  Royal Navy.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Volunteers raised as aforesaid in any Colony shall form Part of the
  Royal Naval Reserve, in addition to the Volunteers who may be raised
  under the Act of 1859, but, except as in this Act expressly provided,
  shall be subject exclusively to the Provisions made as aforesaid by the
  proper Legislative Authority of the Colony.</p>

  <p>"It shall be lawful for Her Majesty in Council from Time to Time as
  Occasion requires, and on such Conditions as seem fit, to authorize the
  Admiralty to issue to any Officer of the Royal Navy volunteering for the
  Purpose a Special Commission for Service in accordance with the
  Provisions of this Act.</p>

  <p>"It shall be lawful for Her Majesty in Council from Time to Time as
  Occasion requires, and on such Conditions as seem fit, to authorize the
  Admiralty to accept any Offer for the Time being made or to be made by
  the Government of a Colony, to place at Her Majesty's Disposal any Vessel
  of War provided by that Government and the Men and Officers from Time to
  Time serving therein; and while any Vessel accepted by the Admiralty
  under such Authority is at the Disposal of Her Majesty, such Vessel shall
  be deemed to all Intents a Vessel of War of the Royal Navy, and <!-- Page
  80 --><span class="pagenum" title="091.png"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>the Men and Officers from Time to Time
  serving in such Vessels shall be deemed to all Intents Men and Officers
  of the Royal Navy, and shall accordingly be subject to all Enactments and
  Regulations for the Time being in force for the Discipline of the Royal
  Navy.</p>

  <p>"It shall be lawful for Her Majesty in Council from Time to Time as
  Occasion requires, and on such Conditions as seem fit, to authorize the
  Admiralty to accept any Offer for the Time being made or to be made by
  the Government of a Colony, to place at Her Majesty's Disposal for
  general Service in the Royal Navy the whole or any Part of the Body of
  Volunteers with all or any of the Officers raised and appointed by that
  Government in accordance with the Provisions of this Act; and when any
  such Offer is accepted such of the Provisions of the Act of 1859 as
  relate to Men of the Royal Naval Reserve raised in the United Kingdom
  when in actual Service shall extend and apply to the Volunteers whose
  Services are so accepted."</p>

  <p>As the Act winds up by saying that "nothing in this Act shall take
  away or abridge any power vested in or exerciseable by the Legislature or
  Government of any Colony," it is evident that the whole arrangement is a
  purely voluntary one.</p>

  <p>The vessels of the Mercantile Marine registered as belonging to any of
  the Colonies, fly the red ensign without any distinguishing badge, so
  that a Victorian or Canadian merchantman coming up the Thames or Mersey
  would probably fly a flag in all respects similar (Fig. <a
  href="#fig97">97</a>) to that of a merchant vessel owned in the United
  Kingdom. There is, however, no objection to colonial merchant vessels
  carrying distinctive flags with the badge of the Colony thereon, in
  addition to the red ensign, provided that the Lords Commissioners of the
  Admiralty give their warrant of authorization. The red ensign differenced
  may be seen in Fig. <a href="#fig129">129</a>, the merchant flag of
  Canada,<a name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and in Fig. <a
  href="#fig134">134</a> that of Victoria, the device on this latter
  bearing the five stars, representing the constellation of the Southern
  Cross&mdash;a simple, appropriate, and beautiful device. <!-- Page 81
  --><span class="pagenum" title="092.png"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span></p>

  <p>"Governors of Her Majesty's Dominions in foreign parts, and governors
  of all ranks and denominations administering the governments of British
  Colonies and Dependencies shall"&mdash;as set forth in "Queen's
  Regulations"&mdash;"fly the Union Jack with the arms or badge of the
  Colony emblazoned in the centre thereof." Figs. <a href="#fig139">139</a>
  and <a href="#fig141">141</a> are illustrations, the first being the
  special flag of the Viceroy of India, and the second that of the Governor
  of Western Australia. The Governor-General of Canada has in the centre of
  his flag the arms of the Dominion, while the Lieutenant-Governors of
  Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia,
  and Prince Edward's Island have in the centre of their flags the arms of
  their province alone. These arms in each case are placed on a shield
  within a white circle, and surrounded by a wreath. The Admiralty
  requirements are that the Colonial badge on the governor's flag should be
  placed within a "green garland," and this is understood to be of laurel;
  but in 1870 Canada received the Imperial sanction to substitute the
  leaves of the maple.<a name="NtA_56"
  href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Though the provinces that together make the Dominion of Canada are
  seven in number, the Canadian shield only shows the arms of
  four&mdash;Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick&mdash;an
  arrangement that can be scarcely palatable to the other three.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Queen's Warrant, published in the <i>Canadian Gazette</i> of
  November 25th, 1869, is as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"VICTORIA, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
  and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"To Our Right Trusty and well-beloved Councillor, Edward George
  Fitzalan Howard (commonly called Lord Edward George Fitzalan Howard),
  Deputy to Our Right Trusty and Right entirely beloved cousin, Henry Duke
  of Norfolk, Earl Marshal and Our Hereditary Marshal of
  England&mdash;greeting<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Whereas</span>, by virtue of, and under the
  authority of an Act of Parliament, passed in the Twenty-ninth year of Our
  Reign, entitled 'An Act for the Union of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New
  Brunswick, and the Government thereof," we were empowered to declare
  after a certain day therein appointed, that the said Provinces of Canada,
  Nova Scotia and New Brunswick should <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="093.png"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span>form one
  Dominion under the name of Canada. And it was provided that on and after
  the day so appointed, Canada should be divided into four Provinces,
  named, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; that the part of
  the then Province of Canada, which formerly constituted the Province of
  Upper Canada, should constitute the Province of Ontario; and the part
  which formerly constituted the Province of Lower Canada, should
  constitute the Province of Quebec; and that the Provinces of Nova Scotia
  and New Brunswick should have the same limits as at the passing of the
  said Act. And whereas we did by Our Royal Proclamation, bearing date the
  Twenty-second day of May last, declare, ordain, and command that, on and
  after the first day of July, 1867, the said Provinces should form and be
  one Dominion under the name of Canada accordingly.</p>

  <p>"And forasmuch as it is Our Royal will and pleasure that, for the
  greater honour and distinction of the said Provinces, certain Armorial
  Ensigns should be assigned to them,</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Know ye</span>, therefore, that We, of our Princely
  Grace and special favour, have granted and assigned, and by these
  presents do grant and assign the Armorial Ensigns following, that is to
  say<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">For the Province of Ontario</span>:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Vert, a sprig of three Leaves of Maple slipped, or, on a chief Argent
  the Cross of St. George.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">For the Province of Quebec</span>:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Or, on a Fess Gules between two Fleurs de Lis in chief Azure, and a
  Sprig of three Leaves of Maple slipped vert in base, a Lion passant
  guardant or.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">For the Province of Nova Scotia</span>:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Or, on a Fess Wavy Azure between three Thistles proper, a Salmon
  Naiant Argent.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">For the Province of New Brunswick</span>:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Or, on waves a Lymphad, or Ancient Galley, with oars in action,
  proper, on a chief Gules a Lion passant guardant or, as the same are
  severally depicted in the margin hereof, to be borne for the said
  respective Provinces on Seals, Shields, Banners, Flags, or otherwise
  according to the Laws of Arms.</p>

  <p>"And We are further pleased to declare that the said United Provinces
  of Canada, being one Dominion under the name of <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="094.png"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>Canada,
  shall, upon all occasions that may be required, use a common Seal, to be
  called the 'Great Seal of Canada,' which said seal shall be composed of
  the Arms of the said Four Provinces quarterly, all which armorial
  bearings are set forth in this Our Royal Warrant."</p>

  <p>This latter point is a somewhat important one, as owing to the
  semi-official endorsement given in many colonial publications, it appears
  to be a popular misconception that as many different arms as possible are
  to be crowded in. In one example before us five are represented, the
  additional one being Manitoba. In a handbook on the history, production,
  and natural resources of Canada, prepared by the Minister of Agriculture
  for the Colonial Exhibition, held in London in 1886, the arms of the
  seven provinces are given separately, grouped around a central shield
  that includes them all. The whole arrangement is styled "Arms of the
  Dominion and of the Provinces of Canada."</p>

  <p>When the Queen's Warrant was issued in 1869, Ontario, Quebec, Nova
  Scotia, and New Brunswick were the only members of the Confederation.
  Manitoba entered it in 1870, British Columbia in 1871, and Prince Edward
  Island in 1873.</p>

  <p>The Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron,
  and the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club have the privilege of flying the blue
  ensign.</p>

  <p>Canada, unlike Australia, supplies no contingent towards the Imperial
  Navy, but she has spent on public works over forty million pounds
  sterling. By her great trans-continental railway a valuable alternative
  route to the East is furnished; she provides graving docks at Quebec,
  Halifax, and Victoria; trains an annual contingent of forty thousand
  volunteers, supports a military college at Kingston, of whose cadets
  between eighty and ninety are now officers in the British Army; and in
  many other ways contributes to the well-being of the Empire, that Greater
  Britain, which has been not unaptly termed "a World-Venice, with the sea
  for streets."</p>

  <p>The badges of the various Colonies of the Empire, as shown in the
  official flag-book of the Admiralty, are very diverse in appearance; some
  pleasing and others less charming, perhaps, than fantastic. It is
  needless to particularise them all. Some, like those of Mauritius,
  Jamaica, and of Cape Colony (Fig. <a href="#fig127">127</a>) are heraldic
  in character, while others&mdash;as Barbadoes, where Britannia rides the
  waves in a chariot drawn by sea-horses, or South Australia, where
  Britannia lands on a rocky shore on which a black man is seated&mdash;are
  symbolical. Queensland has the simple and pleasing device we see in Fig.
  <a href="#fig128">128</a>, the Maltese Cross, having a crown at its
  centre. Newfoundland has a crown on a white disc and the <!-- Page 84
  --><span class="pagenum" title="095.png"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>Latinised name <i>Terra Nova</i> beneath,
  and Fiji (Fig. <a href="#fig137">137</a>) adopts a like simple device,
  the crown and the word Fiji, while New Guinea does not get even so far as
  this, but has the crown, and beneath it the letters N. G. The gnu appears
  as the device of Natal; the black swan (Fig. <a href="#fig141">141</a>)
  as the emblem of West Australia. An elephant and palm-tree on a yellow
  ground stand for West Africa, and an elephant and temple for Ceylon.
  British North Borneo (Fig. <a href="#fig132">132</a>), on a yellow disc
  has a red lion, and Tasmania (Fig. <a href="#fig133">133</a>), on a white
  ground has the same, though it will be noted that the action of the two
  royal beasts is not quite the same. The Straits Settlements have the
  curious device seen in Fig. <a href="#fig131">131</a>. New Zealand (Fig.
  <a href="#fig136">136</a>) has a cross of stars on a blue field. Victoria
  we have already seen in Figs. <a href="#fig134">134</a> and <a
  href="#fig135">135</a>, while New South Wales has upon the white field
  the Cross of St. George, having in the centre one of the lions of
  England, and on each arm a star&mdash;an arrangement shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig138">138</a>. British East Africa has the crown, and beneath it
  the golden sun shooting forth its rays, one of the simplest, most
  appropriate, and most pleasing of all the Colonial devices; when placed
  in the centre of the Governor's flag it is upon a white disc, and the sun
  has eight principal rays. When for use on the red or blue ensigns, the
  sun has twelve principal rays, and both golden sun and crown are placed
  directly upon the field of the flag. St. Helena, Trinidad, Bermuda,
  British Guiana, Leeward Isles, Labuan, Bahamas, and Hong Kong all have
  devices in which ships are a leading feature&mdash;in the Bermuda device
  associated with the great floating dock, in the Hong Kong with junks, and
  in the other cases variously differentiated from each other, so that all
  are quite distinct in character. In the device of the Leeward Isles,
  designed by Sir Benjamin Pine, a large pine-apple is growing in the
  foreground, and three smaller ones away to the right. It is jocularly
  assumed that the centre one was Sir Benjamin himself, and the three
  subordinate ones his family.</p>

  <p>With Great Britain the command of the ocean is all-important. By our
  sea-power our great Empire has been built up, and by it alone can it
  endure. "A power to which Rome in the height of her glory is not to be
  compared&mdash;a power which has dotted over the surface of the whole
  globe her possessions and military posts, whose morning drum-beat,
  following the sun, and keeping company with the hours, circles the earth
  with one continuous and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England."
  So spoke Daniel Webster in 1834, and our ever-growing responsibilities
  have greatly increased since the more than sixty years when those words
  were uttered. Let us in conclusion turn to the "True Greatness of
  Kingdoms and Estates," written by Bacon, a great and patriotic
  Englishman, where we may read the warning words<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span> <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum" title="096.png"
  ><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span></p>

  <p>"We see the great effects of battles by sea; the Battle of Actium
  decided the empire of the world; the Battle of Lepanto arrested the
  greatness of the Turk.</p>

  <p>"There be many examples where sea-fights have been final to the war;
  but this is when princes or States have set up their rest upon the
  battles; but this much is certain, that he who commands the sea is at
  great liberty, and may take as much and as little of the war as he will,
  whereas those that be strongest by land are many times, nevertheless, in
  great straits.</p>

  <p>"Surely at this day, with us of Europe, the vantage of strength at sea
  (which is one of the dowries of this kingdom of Great Britain) is great;
  both because most of the kingdoms of Europe are not merely inland, but
  girt with the sea most part of their compass, and because the wealth of
  both Indies seems, in great part, but an accessory to the command of the
  seas."</p>

  <p>We are the sons of the men who won us this goodly heritage, and it
  behoves us in turn to hand it on to our descendants in undiminished
  dignity, a world-wide domain beneath the glorious Union Flag that binds
  all in one great brotherhood.</p>

  <p>The well-known Ensign (Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>) of the United
  States of America is the outcome of many changes; the last of a long
  series of National, State, and local devices.</p>

  <p>The first flag planted on American ground was borne thither by
  Christopher Columbus, in the year 1497, and bore on its folds the arms of
  Leon and Castile, a flag divided into four and having upon it, each twice
  repeated, the lion of Leon and the Castle of Castile: the first red on
  white, the second white on red. These arms form a portion of the present
  Spanish Standard, and may be seen in the upper staff corner in Fig. <a
  href="#fig194">194</a>. In this same year&mdash;1497&mdash;Newfoundland
  was discovered, but the first English settlement on the mainland was not
  made until Sir Walter Raleigh took possession of a tract of country in
  1584, naming it Virginia, after Elizabeth, the Virgin-Queen he served,
  and hoisting the Standard of Her Majesty, bearing in its rich blazonry
  (Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>) the ruddy lions of England quartered with
  the golden lilies of France. The Dutch established themselves, in the
  year 1614, in what is now the State of New York; the French, having
  already founded a colony in Canada in 1534, took possession of Louisiana,
  so called after their King Louis, in 1718, while Florida, at first
  French, became Spanish, and in 1763 was ceded to England. <!-- Page 87

  <p>Three ships, bearing the earliest Pilgrim Fathers from England to
  America, had already sailed from England in the year 1606, and these were
  followed by the historic <i>Mayflower</i> and the <i>Plymouth Rock</i>,
  in 1620. While these exiles for conscience sake established for
  themselves a new England in the west, a colony of Scotchmen in the year
  1622 took possession of a tract of land which they named Nova Scotia.
  Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Carolina, Pennsylvania,
  and other colonies were successively formed by parties of
  Englishmen&mdash;the final outcome of peaceful settlement, or the
  arbitrament of the sword, being that the greater part of the eastern
  seaboard, and the country beyond it, came under the sway of the English
  Crown, until injudicious taxation and ill-advised repression led at
  length to open discontent and disloyalty, and finally to revolution and
  the birth of the great Republic of the West.</p>

  <p>So long as the Colonists owed allegiance to the British crown, one
  would naturally have taken for granted that they would have been found
  beneath the national flag, but this was not altogether the case. In the
  early days of New England the Puritans strongly objected to the red cross
  on the flag: not from any disloyalty to the old country, but from a
  conscientious objection to the use of a symbol which they deemed
  idolatrous. By the year 1700, though the Cross of St. George was still
  the leading device, the different colonies began to employ special
  devices to distinguish their vessels from those of England and of each
  other.<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> This, though it
  indicated a certain jealousy and independence amongst the colonies
  themselves, was no proof of any desire for separation from the old
  country, and even when, later on, the dispute between King and Colonists
  became acute, we find them parting from the old flag with great
  reluctance. Fig. <a href="#fig142">142</a> is a very good illustration of
  this; its date is 1775.</p>

  <p>In the early stages of the Revolution each section adopted a flag of
  its own, and it was only later on, when the desirability of union and
  uniformity became evident, that the necessity for one common flag was
  felt. Thus, the people of Massachusetts ranged themselves beneath banners
  bearing pine trees; the men of South Carolina went in for rattle-snakes;
  the New Yorkers adopted a white flag with a black beaver thereon; the
  Rhode Islanders had a white flag with a blue anchor upon it; and, in like
  manner, each contingent adopted its special device.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#fig144">144</a>, one of the flags of the insurgents
  at Bunker's Hill, <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum" title="099.png"
  ><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>June 17th, 1775, we see that the Cross
  of St. George is still preserved, and it might well fly in company with
  Fig. <a href="#fig67">67</a>, a flag of the London Trained Bands, except
  that in the corner we see the pine tree. In Fig. <a
  href="#fig145">145</a> the English emblem has dropped out and the pine
  tree has become much more conspicuous, and in Figs. <a
  href="#fig147">147</a> and <a href="#fig148">148</a> all suggestion of
  St. George or of the red or blue Ensigns has disappeared. This arboreal
  device was not by any means a new one to the men of Massachusetts. We
  find a mint established at Boston as early as 1651, busily engaged in
  coining the silver captured from the Spaniards by the Buccaneers. On one
  side was the date and value of the coin, and, on the reverse, a tree in
  the centre and "In Massachusetts" around it. It must be remembered that
  at the time there was no king to resent this encroachment on the royal
  prerogative, and no notice was taken of it by the Parliament or by
  Cromwell. There was a tacit allowance of it afterwards, even by Charles
  II., for more than twenty years. It will be remembered that on his
  enquiry into the matter he was told by some courtier that the device was
  intended for the Royal Oak, and the question was allowed to drop.</p>

  <p>South Carolina adopted the rattle-snake flag at the suggestion of one
  Gadsden, a delegate to the General Congress of the South Carolina
  Convention in 1776. On a yellow ground was placed a rattlesnake, having
  thirteen rattles; the reptile was coiled ready to strike, and beneath was
  the warning motto, "Don't tread on me." The number thirteen had reference
  to the thirteen revolted States, as it was originally proposed that this
  flag should be the navy flag for all the States. As an accessory to a
  portrait of Commodore Hopkins, "Commander-in-chief of the American
  fleet," we see a flag of thirteen alternate red and white stripes. It has
  no canton, but undulating diagonally across the stripes is a rattlesnake.
  The idea was not altogether a new one, as we find the <i>Pennsylvania
  Gazette</i>, in commenting twenty-five years previously on the iniquity
  of the British Government in sending its convicts to America, suggesting
  as a set off that "a cargo of rattlesnakes should be distributed in St.
  James's Park, Spring Gardens, and other places of pleasure." At the
  commencement of any great struggle by a revolting people there is often a
  great variety of device, and it is only after a while that such a
  multiplicity is found to be a danger. Hence we find that prior to the
  yellow rattlesnake flag, South Carolina had, with equal enthusiasm,
  adopted the blue flag with the crescent moon that we have figured in No.

  <p>In the year 1775 a committee was appointed to consider the question of
  a single flag for the thirteen States. This ensign, though it went far
  towards moulding these different sections into the United States, was a
  curious illustration of that reluctance that we have already referred to,
  to sever themselves finally from the Old Country, as the Committee
  recommended the retention of the Union in the upper corner next the
  staff, but substituted for the broad red field of the rest of the flag
  thirteen horizontally disposed stripes, alternately red and white, the
  emblems of the union into one of the thirteen colonies in their struggle
  against oppression. We have this represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig57">57</a>. It was also the flag of the East India Company.</p>

  <p>On the final declaration of Independence, when the severance from the
  Old Country was irrevocable, and the colonists became a nation, the
  question of a national flag was one of the points awaiting solution; but
  it was not till about a year afterwards that a decision was come to. The
  vessels commissioned by Washington flew the flag we have figured in No.
  <a href="#fig147">147</a>; this was approved in April, 1776, and remained
  in use some little time, as did also the one represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig149">149</a>. Sometimes we find the cross and pine-tree removed
  and the whole flag nothing but the red and white stripes. This flag
  composed of stripes alone was not peculiar to the American navy, as a
  flag of similar design was for a long time a well-known signal in the
  British fleet, being that used for the red division to form up into line
  of battle.</p>

  <p>Anyone looking over a collection of the common pottery made from about
  a hundred and fifty years ago up to comparatively recent times will find
  that stirring contemporary events are very freely
  introduced&mdash;sea-fights, portraits of leading statesmen, generals,
  and so forth. These are often caricatures, as, for example, the hundreds
  that may be seen in our various museums and private collections derisive
  of "Boney," while others are as historically correct as the potter's
  knowledge and skill could compass. Anyone visiting the Corporation Museum
  at Brighton will find a jug bearing the head of Zebulon M. Pike, an
  American general; trophies of flags are grouped around this, but the only
  flag with any device upon it is a plain striped one. Another that bears
  the head of Commodore Decatur, U.S.N., has below it a cannon, on the left
  a trophy of flags and weapons, and on the right a ship; and a very
  similar jug may be seen in honour of Commodore Parry. In each of these
  cases the flags in the trophies and on the ships are simply striped.</p>

  <p>On August 14th, 1777, Congress resolved "that the flag of the United
  States be thirteen stripes, alternately red and white, and that the Union
  be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing <!-- Page 90
  --><span class="pagenum" title="101.png"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>a new constellation."<a name="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> This was the birth of the national
  flag, "the stars and stripes," and it would appear at first sight to be a
  final settlement of the device, though in practice the result did not
  work out at all uniformly, the number of stripes being unequal. If we
  commence at the top with a white one, we shall have seven white and six
  red, whereas if we begin with a red stripe we shall get seven red and six
  white. Each of these renderings was for some years in use, until it was
  authoritatively laid down that the latter was the arrangement to be
  adopted. It seems a minor point, but any of our readers who will re-draw
  Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a> and transpose the colours of the stripes,
  so that the upper and lower edges of the flag are white instead of red,
  will be surprised to note how so apparently trivial a change will affect
  the appearance of the flag.<a name="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> In like manner the stars were sometimes
  made with six points, and at others with five. Even so late as 1779, we
  find such a striking variation as a flag bearing stars with eight points,
  and its stripes alternately red, blue, and white. The coins issued during
  the presidency of Washington had five-pointed stars on them, but later on
  they had six points. Nobody seems now to know why this change was
  made.</p>

  <p>As nothing was said in this resolution of Congress as to the
  arrangement of the stars on the blue field, a further opening for variety
  of treatment was found. In some of the early flags they were arranged to
  represent the letters U.S., in others they were all placed in a circle,
  in others again they were dispersed irregularly, so as the better to
  suggest a constellation; and it was finally ordered that they should be
  placed in parallel horizontal rows, as we now see them.</p>

  <p>Though the stars did not appear in the American flag until 1777, we
  find in a poem in the <i>Massachusetts Spy</i> of March 10th, 1774, on
  the outbreak of the rebellion, the lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The American ensign now sparkles a star</p>
      <p>Which shall shortly flame wide through the skies."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum" title="102.png"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span></p>

  <p>This poetic and prophetic flight is the earliest suggestion of the
  stars in the national flag of the United States.</p>

  <p>It has been held that the American Eagle and the stars and stripes of
  the national flag were suggested by the crest and arms of the Washington
  family. This statement has been often made; hence we find an American
  patriot writing:&mdash;"It is not a little curious that the poor,
  worn-out rag of feudalism, as many would count it, should have expanded
  into the bright and ample banner that now waves on every sea." But that
  it should be so seems by no means an established fact. No reference is
  made to it in Washington's correspondence, or in that of any of his
  contemporaries. The arms of the Washington family are a white shield
  having two horizontal red bars, and above these a row of three red stars;
  and this certainly bears some little resemblance to the American flag,
  but how much is mere coincidence, and how much is adaptation it is
  impossible to say. These arms may be seen on a brass in Solgrave Church,
  Huntingdonshire, on the tomb of Laurence Washington, the last lineal
  ancestor who was buried in England. He was twice Mayor of Northampton, in
  1533 and in 1546, and the first President of the United States was his
  great-great-grandson. He was a man of considerable influence, and on the
  dissolution of the monasteries Henry gave him the Priory of St. Andrews,
  Northampton. In the troublous times that succeeded, his son John went to
  America, and lived for some twenty years on the banks of the Potomac.</p>

  <p>Another theory that has been advanced is that the blue quarter was
  taken from the blue banner of the Scotch Covenanters, and was therefore
  significant of the Solemn League and Covenant of the United Colonies
  against oppression, while the stripes were a blending of the red colours
  used in the army with the white flags used in the navy. We give the
  theory for what it is worth, which we venture to say is not very much;
  but as it was advanced by an American writer, we give it place.</p>

  <p>Should our readers care to consider yet another theory, they may learn
  that the genesis of the star-spangled banner was very much less prosaic.
  Prose has it that a Committee of Council, accompanied by General
  Washington, called on Mrs. Ross, an upholstress of Arch Street,
  Philadelphia, and engaged her to make a flag from a rough sketch that
  they brought with them, that she in turn suggested one or two practical
  modifications, and that at her wish Washington re-drew it there and then,
  that she at once set to work on it, and in a few hours the first
  star-spangled flag was floating in the breeze; but the poet ignores the
  services of Mrs. Ross altogether, and declares that <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="103.png"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When Freedom from her mountain height</p>
      <p>Unfurled her standard to the air,</p>
      <p>She tore the azure robe of Night</p>
      <p>And set the stars of glory there.</p>
      <p>She mingled with its gorgeous dyes</p>
      <p>The milky baldric of the skies,</p>
      <p>And striped its pure celestial white</p>
      <p>With streakings of the morning light:</p>
      <p>Then from his mansion in the sun</p>
      <p>She called her eagle-bearer down</p>
      <p>And gave into his mighty hand</p>
      <p>The symbol of her chosen land."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This view was expressed by another great American in the
  words:&mdash;"As at the early dawn the stars shine forth even while it
  grows light, and then, as the sun advances, that light breaks out into
  banks and streaming lines of colour, the glowing red and intense light
  striving together and ribbing the horizon with bars effulgent, so on the
  American flag stars and beams of light shine out together. Where this
  flag comes, and men behold it, they see in its sacred emblazoning no
  ramping lions, and no fierce eagle, no embattled castles, or insignia of
  imperial authority: they see the symbols of light: it is the banner of
  dawn; it means Liberty!"</p>

  <p>We have clearly now got a long way from the establishment in Arch
  Street. This flag, which, after such glowing passages as the foregoing,
  we should almost expect to find too sacred a thing for change or
  criticism, has undergone some few modifications in its details, though
  the original broad idea has remained untouched.</p>

  <p>As the first conception was that each of the original thirteen States
  was represented in the national flag by a star and a stripe, other
  States, as they came into the Union, naturally expected the same
  consideration: hence on the admission of Vermont in 1791, and Kentucky in
  1792, an Act was passed which increased the number of stars and stripes
  from thirteen to fifteen. Later on came Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, and
  so forth, and the flag was presently made to consist of twenty stars and
  stripes, but it was found to be so objectionable to be thus continually
  altering it that it was settled in the year 1818 to go back to the
  original thirteen stripes, but to add a star for each new State. Hence
  the stripes show always the original number of the States at the birth of
  the nation, while the stars show the present number in the Union.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to trace the growth of the country, Illinois being
  enrolled in the Union in 1818, Alabama in 1819, Maine in 1820, Missouri
  in 1821, Arkansas in 1836, Michigan in 1837, and so on; but suffice it
  now to say that by 1891 the original thirteen had <!-- Page 93 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="104.png"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>grown to
  forty-four, and it was announced that on and after the 4th of July of
  that year the national flag should bear this latter number of stars. As
  there are still several territories awaiting promotion to the rank of
  States, the constellation is even yet incomplete.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A song for our banner! The watchword recall</p>
      <p class="i2">Which gave the Republic her station;</p>
      <p>United we stand, divided we fall,</p>
      <p class="i2">It made, and preserves us, a nation!</p>

      <p class="i2">The union of States none can sever;</p>
      <p>The union of hearts, the union of hands,</p>
      <p class="i2">And the flag of our Union for ever."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most striking modification of the flag is seen in the Revenue
  Service. We have still the silver stars on the azure field and the
  stripes of alternate red and white, but in this special case the stripes,
  instead of being disposed horizontally, are placed vertically, a slight
  enough difference apparently, but one which makes a striking alteration
  in the appearance of the flag.</p>

  <p>The pendant of the United States Navy is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig151">151</a>; the stars in it, it will be seen, are reduced to
  the original thirteen, while the narrowness of the flag permits but two
  of the stripes.</p>

  <p>The American Jack is simply the blue and white portion of the National
  flag, Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>, made into a separate flag.</p>

  <p>The Commodore's broad pendant is a swallow-tailed blue flag, with one
  white star in the centre. The Admiral's flag, hoisted at the main, is
  shown in Fig. <a href="#fig143">143</a>; the Vice-Admiral's flag, hoisted
  at the fore, has three white stars on the blue field; and the
  Rear-Admiral's flag, hoisted at mizen, has two arranged vertically over
  each other.</p>

  <p>While in some nationalities the flag of the war navy differs from that
  of the mercantile marine&mdash;as in the case of Great Britain, Germany,
  and Spain&mdash;in others the same flag is used. This is so in the United
  States, France, etc.</p>

  <p>The Chief of the State, whether he be called Emperor, King, President,
  or Sultan, has his own flag&mdash;his personal Standard&mdash;and this
  special and personal flag, in the case of the President of the United
  States, has on its blue field an eagle, bearing on its breast a shield
  with the stars and stripes, and beneath it the national motto, "<i>E
  pluribus unum</i>." As it has been suggested that the employment of the
  eagle as a symbol of the State was derived from the crest of Washington,
  it may not be inopportune to state that the crest in question was not an
  eagle at all, but a raven. The idea of the eagle, together with the word
  "Senate," and many such similar <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum" title="105.png"
  ><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>things, no doubt arose from their use in
  ancient Rome, and afforded an illustration the more of the
  pseudo-classicalism that was raging in the eighteenth century in France
  and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The eagle appears on many of the early flags of America. Fig. <a
  href="#fig150">150</a> is a curious example of its use. In an old
  engraving we see a figure of Liberty defended by Washington, and above
  them this flag. In another old print before us we see Washington leaning
  on a cannon, and behind him a flag bearing the stars and stripes, plus an
  eagle, that with outstretched wings fills up much of the field, having in
  his beak a label with the "<i>E pluribus unum</i>" upon it, with one foot
  grasping the thunderbolts of War, and the other the olive-branch of
  Peace.</p>

  <p>Both these eagle-bearing flags, it will be seen, are associated with
  the President; but in many of these early examples there seems no
  necessary connection. Thus in one instance we see a busy ship-building
  scene, and while the ship in the foreground has at stern the stars and
  stripes, at the bowsprit it bears a Jack that is identical with the blue
  and white portion of Fig. <a href="#fig150">150</a>.</p>

  <p>In a Presidential Standard proposed in 1818 the flag is quartered. In
  the first quarter are twenty white stars on a blue field; in the second
  quarter is the eagle and thunderbolt; in the third a sitting figure
  emblematic of Liberty; in the fourth, seven red horizontal stripes
  alternating with six white ones. We found the flag figured in an old
  American book, but are unable to say whether such a flag was ever
  actually made, proposition and adoption not being altogether the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>History repeated itself on the secession from the Union, in the year
  1860, of North and South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama,
  Georgia, Louisiana, Virginia, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee. There was
  the same desire at first for individuality in the different flags adopted
  by the seceding States, the same unwillingness to break wholly away from
  the old flag, that we have seen as features in the first revolt.</p>

  <p>Louisiana adopted the flag shown in Fig. <a href="#fig156">156</a>;
  this was emblematic of the origin and history of the State, Louisiana
  having been settled by Louis Quatorze in 1718, ceded to Spain at the
  peace of 1763, restored to France in 1802, sold by France to America in
  1803, and admitted as a State of the Union in 1812. The Spanish Flag,
  Fig. <a href="#fig192">192</a>, is red and yellow, hence the golden star
  on the ruddy field, while the stripes of red, white and blue are the
  colours found in the flags of France and America.</p>

  <p>On the election of President Lincoln in November, 1860, South
  Carolina, by vote of Convention, proclaimed her resumption of
  independence as a Sovereign State, and on the 17th of the month the new
  State Flag, having a green Palmetto palm in the centre of a <!-- Page 95
  --><span class="pagenum" title="106.png"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>field of white, was hoisted in Charleston
  amidst the ringing of bells, a salute of one hundred guns, and every
  possible sign of public rejoicing. In January, 1861, the flag shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig155">155</a> was substituted, the old crescent moon of
  the first rebellion, 1775, reappearing, but in the <i>Charleston
  Mercury</i>, of January 29th, 1861, we read that "the Legislature last
  night again altered the design of the State Flag. It now consists of a
  blue field with a white Palmetto palm tree in the middle. The white
  crescent in the upper flagstaff corner remains as before, but the horns
  pointing upwards. This may be regarded as final." This flag is shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig159">159</a>. Fig. <a href="#fig160">160</a> is the
  flag of Texas&mdash;"the lone star" State.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hurrah for the Lone Star!</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When it became necessary, as it almost immediately did, to adopt one
  flag as the common Ensign of all the Confederate States, a special
  committee was appointed to consider the matter, and to study the numerous
  designs submitted to them. On presenting their report the Chairman
  said&mdash;"A flag should be simple, readily made, and capable of being
  made up in bunting; it should be different from the flag of any other
  country, place, or people: it should be significant: it should be readily
  distinguishable at a distance: the colours should be well contrasted and
  durable: and lastly, and not the least important point, it should be
  effective and handsome. The Committee humbly think that the flag which
  they submit combines these requirements. It is very easy to make; it is
  entirely different from any other national flag. The three colours of
  which it is composed&mdash;red, white, and blue&mdash;are the true
  Republican Colours; they are emblematic of the three great
  virtues&mdash;valour, purity, and truth. Naval men assure us that it can
  be recognised at a great distance. The colours contrast admirably, and
  are lasting. In effect and appearance it must speak for itself." The
  flag, thus highly and justly commended, was first hoisted on March 4th,
  1861, at Montgomery. It is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig152">152</a>,
  and was quickly known as the "Stars and Bars."<a name="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Even the <i>New York Herald</i>
  admitted that "the design of this flag is striking, and it has <!-- Page
  96 --><span class="pagenum" title="107.png"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>the merit of originality as well as of
  durability." The circle of white stars was intended to correspond in
  number with the States in the Confederacy, but no great attention seems
  to have been paid to this. The flag may be seen engraved on the paper
  money of the different Southern States, and on other Government papers.
  In one example before us the stars are seven in number, and in another
  nine are shown, the number of seceding States being eleven.</p>

  <p>While the "Stars and Bars," Fig. <a href="#fig152">152</a>, was quite
  a different flag from Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>, the "Stars and
  Stripes," it was found that, nevertheless, in the stress of battle
  confusion arose; so the battle flag, Fig. <a href="#fig153">153</a>,
  known as the "Southern Cross," became largely adopted, though its use was
  never actually legalised. Here, again, we find that though eleven should
  be the proper number of the stars, they are in our illustration thirteen,
  while in one example we have found seventeen. It would be found in
  practice very difficult to make a pleasing arrangement of eleven stars;
  given a central one, and two on either side of it in the arms of the
  cross, and we get nine as a result, with three on either side it will
  total to thirteen, and with four it must take seventeen. In a few
  instances it may be seen without the red portions&mdash;a white flag with
  the blue cross and white stars. One great objection to the Southern Cross
  was that it was not adapted for sea service, since being alike in
  whatever way it was looked at, it could not be reversed in case of
  distress. To obviate this difficulty, at a Congress in Richmond in 1863
  the form seen in Fig. <a href="#fig154">154</a> was adopted&mdash;a plain
  white flag having the Southern Cross as its Union; but this, in turn, was
  objected to as being too much like a flag of truce, so to meet this, in
  the following year, it was ordered that the space between the Union and
  the outer edge of the flag should be divided vertically in half, and that
  the outer half should be red: an alteration that may have been necessary,
  but which greatly spoiled the appearance of what was, before this, a
  handsome and striking flag. As the struggle came to an end in the
  following year, the "Stars and Bars" and the "Southern Cross" perished in
  the general downfall of the Southern cause&mdash;the victories of
  Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Shenandoah Valley, Chattanooga, and
  many another hard-fought field, and the brilliant strategy of Lee,
  Beauregard, Longstreet, Jackson, Early, Hood, and many another gallant
  commander, being all in vain against the unlimited resources of the
  North. Over six hundred and fifty thousand human lives, over seven
  hundred millions of pounds sterling, were spent in what an American
  writer delicately calls "the late unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>The Americans, jealous of the honour of their flag, have sometimes, to
  our insular notions, a rather odd way of showing it. Some <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum" title="108.png"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>of our readers will remember how an
  American, some time ago, undertook to carry the flag of his country
  through England. Whatever visions he or his compatriots may have had of
  his defending it gallantly against hostile attack were soon proved to be
  baseless. Englishmen, <i>cela va sans dire</i>, have no hostility to the
  Americans, and the populace&mdash;urban, suburban, and
  rural&mdash;everywhere entered into the humour of the thing, and cheered
  the gallant sergeant and his bunting wherever he appeared. All the risk
  and terror of the exploit melted away in general acclamation and hearty
  welcome. An Englishman told us that in descending a mountain in Norway he
  met an American carrying something rolled up; he unfolded it, and
  displayed the Stars and Stripes, and said that he had brought it to plant
  on the summit of the mountain. Why he should do so is by no means
  apparent: but still, as it pleased him and hurt no one else, it would be
  churlish, indeed, to demur to so innocent a pastime. Our friend
  courteously raised his hat to the symbol of the great daughter nation
  over the ocean, whereupon the American heartily reciprocated, saying,
  "Thanks, stranger; and here's to the Union Jack."<a name="NtA_62"

  <p>When the French declared war against Prussia, on July 16th, 1870, they
  were entirely unprepared for the enthusiasm and unity with which the
  various German States rallied together against the common opponent. It
  was thought that the Southern and Catholic States would, at least, be
  neutral, if they did not side with France against a Power that, during
  previous conflict with Austria, had laid heavy hand on those that had
  then taken sides against her. But this, after all, had been but a quarrel
  amongst themselves; and the attempt of France to violate German soil was
  at once the signal for Germans to stand shoulder to shoulder in one
  brotherhood against the common foe. The separate interests and grievances
  of Bavarians, Saxons, Hessians, Badeners, Brunswickers, Wurtemburgers,
  Hanoverians, were at once put aside, and united Germany, in solid
  phalanx, rose in irresistible might. In the great historic Palace of
  Versailles, in the hall dedicated "to all the glories of France," the
  Confederate Princes of Germany, headed by the King of Bavaria, <!-- Page
  98 --><span class="pagenum" title="109.png"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>conferred on the King of Prussia the title
  of Emperor of Germany, bestowing on him the duty of representing all the
  German States in international questions, and appointing him and his
  successors the Commander-in-chief of the German forces. Thus, on January
  17th, 1871, amid the acclamation of the allied Sovereigns and the deep
  bass of the cannon in the trenches surrounding the beleagured capital of
  the common enemy, the principle of German unity received its seal and
  consummation.</p>

  <p>The War Ensign of the Empire is represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig207">207</a>. The colours of Prussia, black and white, and the
  Prussian Eagle enter largely into it, and perhaps it may at first sight
  appear that these symbols of the Prussian State are even a little too
  conspicuous, but it must be borne in mind that it is to the Sovereign of
  this State the headship of all is given, and that the vital interests of
  Prussia in the matter may be further illustrated by the fact that while
  she has a population, in round numbers, of thirty millions, Bavaria has
  but five, and Saxony three, while the Wurtemburgers and Badeners between
  them make up about another three millions, and no other State in the
  Empire comes at all near these figures. Prussia has over 130,000 square
  miles of territory to fight for, while Bavaria has but 29,292, and the
  next largest, Wurtemburg, has only an area of 7,531; in every way,
  political, commercial, or what not, the interests of Prussia are
  overwhelmingly predominant.</p>

  <p>The flag of West Prussia is the black, white, black, shewn in Fig. <a
  href="#fig211">211</a>, while the East Prussian flag is made up of but
  two horizontal strips, the upper black and the lower white. Hence the
  well-known war song, "Ich bin ein Preussen,"<a name="NtA_63"

  <div class="poem">

  <p>The black, white, and red canton in the staff-head corner of the flag
  is also made into an independent flag, as at Fig. <a
  href="#fig208">208</a>, and used as a "Jack" in the Imperial Navy, while
  this same flag, Fig. <a href="#fig208">208</a>, minus the cross, is the
  flag of the Mercantile Marine. On the 25th of October, 1867, on the
  establishment of the North German Confederacy, at the conclusion of the
  Austro-Prussian campaign, the King of Prussia sanctioned a proposal for a
  flag common to all. We find in this decree that "the confederate flag
  henceforth solely to bear the qualification of the national flag, and as
  such to be exclusively on board the merchantmen of the Confederacy, shall
  be composed of three equilateral stripes horizontally arranged: the
  colour of the top one being black, the middle stripe white, and that of
  the bottom stripe red." On the inclusion of the South German States on
  the formation of the German Empire, the latter still more potent and
  august body retained the Confederacy Flag for its mercantile marine. Up
  to the year 1867 no German national flag had ever flown on the ocean, as
  the various States and free cities had their special colours of merely
  local value.</p>

  <p>The responsible Minister of the Crown, in a speech delivered in the
  Diet in 1867, stated to the members that the combination of colours was
  emblematic of a junction of the black-white Prussian flag with the
  red-white ensign of the Hanseatic League. This league of the sea-ports of
  Germany was organised in 1164 for their mutual defence and for the
  interchange of commercial advantages. As its strength and reputation
  increased, many other cities sought to be admitted, but international
  jealousies disintegrated the League, and by the year 1630 it was reduced
  from sixty-six cities to three&mdash;Lubeck, Hamburg, and Bremen. These
  three Hanse towns still retain special privileges. The red and the white
  in the German flag represents the commercial prosperity of the nation,
  while the black and white symbolises the strong arm of the State prepared
  to protect and foster it. The flags of these three cities still retain
  the old colours, Lubeck being half white and half red, Bremen red and
  white stripes, and Hamburg a white castle on a red field.</p>

  <p>The arms of the Hohenzollerns are quarterly arranged. The first and
  fourth quarters are themselves quartered, black and white for Zollern,
  while the second and third quarters are azure with a golden stag for
  Sigmaringen. Friedrich VI., the first of the Hohenzollerns, the Burggraf
  of Nürnberg, became Friedrich I., Elector of Brandenburg, in 1417. There
  were twelve in all, of these Hohenzollern Electors, and Friedrich III.,
  the last of these, became in 1701 the first King of Prussia. All the
  succeeding Sovereigns have been of the same house, so that the black and
  <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum" title="111.png"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>white in the flag of to-day is the black
  and white that for over five hundred years has been emblazoned in the
  arms of the Hohenzollerns.</p>

  <p>The cross on the flag (Figs. <a href="#fig207">207</a> and <a
  href="#fig208">208</a>)&mdash;the "iron cross" so highly prized as the
  reward of fine service&mdash;is the cross of the Teutonic Order, and
  dates from the close of the 12th century. The history of the Teutonic
  Order, in its connexion with Prussia, is dealt with very fully in the
  first volume of Carlyle's "Frederick the Great."</p>

  <p>The Imperial Standard of Germany has the iron cross, black with white
  border, on a yellow field, in the centre of all being a shield bearing
  the arms of Prussia, surmounted by a crown and surrounded by the collar
  of the Order of the Black Eagle. The yellow groundwork of the flag is
  diapered over in each quarter with three black eagles and a crown. The
  arms of the cross stretch out to the four edges of the flag.</p>

  <p>The Admiral's flag in the Imperial German Navy is square, and consists
  of the black cross on a white ground&mdash;the cross, as in the standard,
  extending to the edges of the flag. The Vice-Admiral's flag is similar,
  but has in the upper staff-space a black ball in addition, while the
  Rear-Admiral has the same flag again, but with the addition of a black
  ball in each of the quarters nearest the mast. The Chief of the Admiralty
  has a white flag again with the cross in the centre, but in this case
  there is a considerable margin of white all round, and four red anchors
  are placed so that they extend in a sloping direction from the corners of
  the flag towards the inner angles of the cross. We get the characteristic
  black and white again in the burgee of the Imperial Yacht Club, which is
  thus quartered, an upright line meeting a horizontal one in the centre of
  the burgee, and thus giving a first and fourth black quarter and a second
  and third white one. The signal for a pilot again is a white flag with a
  broad border of black; if our readers will take a mourning envelope with
  a good deep margin of black to it, they will see the effect exactly.</p>

  <p>German vessels engaged in trade on the East African coast fly the
  black, white, red, but in the centre of the white stripe is a blue anchor
  placed erect, while the Imperial Governor in East Africa substitutes for
  the anchor the black eagle. The German East Africa Company's flag is
  white cut into quarters by a narrow and parallel-edged cross and a red
  canton with five white stars on it in the quarter nearest the
  masthead.</p>

  <p>While we find amongst the minor States of Germany Oldenburg, Fig. <a
  href="#fig204">204</a>, with a cross-bearing flag, the greater number are
  made up of stripes disposed horizontally, and either two or three in
  number. Thus Fig. <a href="#fig199">199</a> is the white-green of Saxony,
  Fig. <a href="#fig200">200</a> <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum" title="112.png"

  <a href="#fig202">202</a> the blue-white of Pomerania, Fig. <a
  href="#fig203">203</a> the black-red of Wurtemburg, Fig. <a
  href="#fig205">205</a> the red-yellow-blue of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Fig.
  <a href="#fig206">206</a> the blue-yellow of Brunswick, Fig. <a
  href="#fig209">209</a> the green-white of Saxe-Coburg Gotha, Fig. <a
  href="#fig210">210</a> the blue-red-white of Schomberg Lippe, Fig. <a
  href="#fig212">212</a> the red-white of Hesse. Others that we have not
  figured are the red-yellow of Baden, the white-blue of Bavaria, the
  yellow-white of Hanover, the yellow-red of Elsass, the red-yellow of
  Lothringen.<a name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> To these,
  others might be added: Sleswig-Holstein, Brandenburg, Posen, Silesia,
  etc., all agreeing in the same general character.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Standard of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy is yellow, and
  has in its centre the black double-headed eagle and a bordering all round
  composed of equal-sided triangles turning alternately their apices
  inwards and outwards; the first of these are alternately yellow and
  white, the second alternately scarlet and black. On the displayed wings
  of the eagle are the arms of the eleven provinces of the empire.</p>

  <p>The war-ensign of the monarchy in represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig213">213</a>; it is composed of three equal horizontal bands of
  red, white, red, and bears in its centre beneath the Imperial crown a
  shield similarly divided. This flag originated in 1786, when the Emperor
  Joseph II. decreed its introduction. This shield was the heraldic device
  of the ancient Dukes of Austria, and is known to have been in existence
  in the year 1191, as Duke Leopold Heldenthum bore these arms at that date
  during the Crusades.</p>

  <p>The "Oesterreich-Ungarische Monarchie," to give it its official title,
  is under the command of one Sovereign, who is both Emperor of Austria and
  King of Hungary, but each of these great States has its own Parliament,
  Ministry, and Administration. Austria had long held the Hungarians in
  most unwilling subjection, and the disastrous outcome for Austria of the
  war with Prussia made it absolutely essential to make peace with Hungary,
  the Magyars seeing in the humiliation of Austria the opportunity that
  they had long been awaiting of becoming once again an independent State.
  A compromise was effected in February, 1867, by which the Hungarians were
  willing to remain under the rule of the Emperor of Austria, but only on
  condition that he submitted to be crowned King of Hungary, and that in
  the dual monarchy thus <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum" title="113.png"
  ><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>created they should have absolutely
  the same rights and freedom as the Austrians. The Austrian flag, as we
  have seen, is red-white-red, while the Hungarian is red-white-green, and
  a commission being appointed to consider how these two flags could be
  blended into one, introduced on March 6th, 1869, as the result of its
  deliberations, the Austro-Hungarian national flag that we have
  represented in Fig. <a href="#fig214">214</a>.</p>

  <p>The Austrian provinces have chiefly bi- or tri-color flags, the
  stripes being arranged horizontally. Thus Bohemia is red-white; Tyrol is
  white-red; Dalmatia is blue-yellow; Galicia is blue-red; Croatia is
  red-white-blue; Istria yellow-red-blue.</p>

  <p>We are so used in England to the idea that cheering is a spontaneous
  product that it seems strange to find that the official welcome by the
  Austrian fleet to their Emperor is a salute of twenty-one guns, followed
  by fifteen hurrahs. Each rank has its special limit of honour; thus a
  minister of State or field-marshal is saluted by nineteen guns and eleven
  hurrahs; a general by thirteen and seven, while a commodore drops to
  eleven and three; ambassadors, archbishops, consuls, all have their
  definite share of gunpowder and such specified amount of shouting as is
  held to be befitting to their position.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Standard of the Czar of all the Russias is the brilliant
  yellow and black flag represented in Fig. <a href="#fig226">226</a>. The
  introduction of the black two-headed eagle dates back from the year 1472,
  when Ivan the Great married Sophia, a niece of Constantine Palæolagus,
  and thence assumed the arms of the Greek Empire. On the breast of the
  eagle is an escutcheon bearing on its red field in silver the figure of
  St. George slaying the dragon, the whole being surrounded by the collar
  of the Order of St. Andrew. On the displayed wings of the eagle are other
  shields, too small for representation in our figure, bearing the arms of
  Kiow, a silver angel on an azure field; of Novgorod, two black bears on a
  golden shield; of Voldermirz, a golden lion rampant on a red shield; of
  Kasan, a black wyvern on a silver ground, and so forth. The flag of the
  Czarina is similar, except that it has a broad blue bordering to it.</p>

  <p>A new Standard is made for each Czar. It was originally borne before
  him in battle, but this custom has fallen into disuse, and it is now
  deposited with the rest of the regalia. On the heavy gold brocade is
  embroidered the black eagle, and around this the arms of the provinces of
  the Empire. From the eagle that surmounts the staff are pendant the blue
  ribbons of the Order of St. Andrew, embroidered in gold, with the dates
  of the foundation of the Russian State in 862, the baptism by St.
  Vladimir in 986, the union of all Russian possessions under the sceptre
  of John III. in 1497, and the <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum" title="114.png"
  ><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>proclamation of the Empire by Peter
  the Great. Its dedication is a great religious function, and its sacred
  character and its appeal to a lofty patriotism duly enforced. Thus we
  find the Imperial Chaplain addressing the present Czar before the
  consecration of the standard as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"Divine Providence has resolved, by the right of succession to the
  Throne, to entrust to thee, as Supreme Head and Autocrat of the Peoples
  of the Empire of all the Russias, this Sacred Banner, an emblem of its
  unity and power.</p>

  <p>"We pray the Heavenly Father for the union of all thy subjects in
  loyalty and devotion to their Throne and Country, and in the unselfish
  fulfilment of their patriotic duties.</p>

  <p>"May this Banner inspire thy enemies with dread, may it be a sign to
  thee of Divine Assistance, and in the name of God, of the Orthodox Faith,
  of Right and of Justice; may it help thee, in spite of all obstacles, to
  lead thy people to prosperity, greatness, and glory."</p>

  <p>After the Benediction, holy water was sprinkled upon the standard, and
  the Czar, as the embodiment of the Nation, was again addressed<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The Almighty has been pleased, in the course of the law of
  inheritance, to enthrone you as the Sovereign Ruler of all the peoples of
  the Russian nation; this sacred Standard is a token of unity and power.
  We pray it may unite all thy subjects in unquestioning loyalty to the
  Throne and Country, and in unselfish fulfilment of each duty of a
  subject. May it be to thee a sign, terrible to the foes of Russia, of the
  help given by the Lord God to the glory of His Holy Name, that, through
  Orthodox Faith, notwithstanding all limitations, thy people may be led to
  prosperity, greatness, and glory; so shall all nations know that God is
  on our side."</p>

  <p>The Russians venerate St. Andrew as their patron Saint, believing that
  it was he who carried the doctrines of Christianity into their midst.
  Origen asserts that he preached in Scythia. Peter the Great instituted
  under his name and protection, in the year 1698, the first and most noble
  order of Knighthood of the Russian Empire as a reward for the valour of
  his officers in the war against the Ottomans. The badge is the X-like
  cross of St. Andrew displayed upon the Imperial Eagle and pendant from a
  broad blue ribbon. We have already seen that St. Andrew is the Patron
  Saint of Scotland also, but in Scotland the cross, Fig. <a
  href="#fig92">92</a>, is white upon a field of blue, while in Russia,
  Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a>, it is blue upon a field of white. This
  flag, Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a>, is the war ensign, the flag of the
  Imperial Navy.</p>

  <p>The creed of the Russian Church extols the worship of Saints, and
  amongst the numerous subjects of veneration St. George takes <!-- Page
  104 --><span class="pagenum" title="115.png"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>rank next to St. Andrew himself. Hence we
  see his presentment on the Standard of the Czar, and hence Catherine II.,
  in 1762, instituted an order of knighthood in his honour. The badge is a
  cross of gold, having in its centre a medallion with a figure of the
  saint slaying the dragon; the ribbon being yellow and black. St. George,
  we need scarcely remind our readers, is the great warrior-Saint of
  England too, but while we place his scarlet cross, Fig. <a
  href="#fig91">91</a>, on the field of white, the Russians reverse the
  arrangement and place his white cross on scarlet.<a name="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig215">215</a> is the Russian Union Jack that combines
  the crosses of St. Andrew and St. George. Fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a> is
  the British Union Jack that deals with precisely the same
  combination.</p>

  <p>The flag of the Russian merchant service is represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig218">218</a>. This was originally instead of being white, blue,
  red, a flag of blue, white, red. Peter the Great borrowed this from the
  Dutch, amongst whom he learnt ship-building. The Dutch flag, Fig. <a
  href="#fig237">237</a>, it will be seen is a tricolor of red, white,
  blue. Peter simply turned this upside down, and afterwards, for greater
  distinction, charged the central white space with a small blue St.
  Andrew's Cross, as we see in Fig. <a href="#fig219">219</a>, which
  represents this early form of flag. Later on, for still greater clearness
  of distinction, the blue and the white strips changed places, and so we
  get the modern Russian mercantile flag, as shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig218">218</a>. It was evidently undesirable that the flag of the
  great Empire of Russia should be the same as that of a reversed Dutch
  ensign&mdash;a signal of distress and disaster.</p>

  <p>Based upon these two simple forms, the government Cross of St. Andrew,
  Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a>, and the commercial tricolor, Fig. <a
  href="#fig218">218</a>, we get a great variety of official flags. Thus
  Fig. <a href="#fig220">220</a> is a very happy blending of the two forms
  in the flag of a Consul-General, since he is an official of the State,
  and at the same time his duties deal largely with commercial interests;
  and much the same ground may be taken as regards the blending of the two
  flags in Fig. <a href="#fig221">221</a>, the flag of a Russian Chargé
  d'Affaires. Fig. <a href="#fig223">223</a> is the ensign of a Russian
  transport; if of the second division the field of the flag is blue, and
  if of the third it is red, in each of these cases the crossed anchors
  being white. The Russian signal for a pilot is the Jack shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig215">215</a>, but with a broad white border to it. <!-- Page
  105 --><span class="pagenum" title="116.png"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

  <p>A Russian Ambassador or Minister Plenipotentiary flies the flag shown
  in Fig. <a href="#fig222">222</a>. In the Imperial Navy we find a
  considerable variety of flag types. While the full Admiral flies the
  Imperial Naval Flag, Fig. <a href="#fig217">217</a>, that of the
  Vice-Admiral has along its bottom edge a horizontal strip of blue, and
  that of the Rear-Admiral in the same position a strip of red. The flag of
  the Minister of Marine is the official flag, Fig. <a
  href="#fig217">217</a>, except that instead of the four plain white
  spaces there seen these triangles hold each of them a golden anchor, the
  fluke end outwards. There are many other modifications that we need not
  here particularise.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig216">216</a> is the official flag of Poland; the
  device in the canton in the upper corner, the white eagle on the scarlet
  field, is the ancient Polish flag, when Poland was yet a nation.</p>

  <p>The early history of the French flag is lost in obscurity, and it is
  not always easy to trace the various modifications that it has undergone.
  At the earliest date of which we have record we find the kings of the
  Franks marshalling their forces under the plain blue flag known as the
  Chape de St. Martin. Later on the red flag of St. Denis, known as the
  oriflamme, came into use, and was held in great popular esteem, until by
  the tenth century we find it accepted as the national flag, though the
  blue flag still held its ground as a recognised flag. We may, in fact,
  assume that as the Russians placed themselves beneath the protection both
  of St. George and also of St. Andrew, so the French felt that a double
  claim on saintly assistance would be by no means amiss.</p>

  <p>The Chape de St. Martin was originally in the keeping of the monks of
  the Abbey of Marmoutiers, and popular belief held it to be a portion of
  the actual blue cloak that the legend affirms the Saint divided with the
  beggar suppliant. The Counts of Anjou claimed the right to take this blue
  flag to battle with them. We find it borne by Clovis in the year 507
  against Alaric, and again by Charlemagne at the battle of Narbonne; and
  time after time it led the hosts of France to victory. When the kings of
  France transferred the seat of government to Paris, the great local
  Saint, St. Denis, was held in high honour, and the scarlet flag of the
  Abbey Church of St. Denis gradually ousted the blue flag of St. Martin,
  and "St. Denis" became the war-cry of France.<a name="NtA_66"
  href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Fig. <a href="#fig179">179</a> is a
  representation of the oriflamme from some ancient stained glass, but the
  authorities differ somewhat; thus the "Chronique de Flandre" describes it
  as having three points and tassels of green <!-- Page 106 --><span

  attached thereto, while an English authority says, "The celestial
  auriflamb, so by the French admired, was but of one colour, a square
  redde banner." Du Cange gives no hint of its shape, but affirms that it
  was simple, "sans portraiture d'autre affaire." All therefore that seems
  quite definite is that it was a plain scarlet flag. The last time that
  the sacred ensign was borne to battle was at Agincourt on October 25th,
  1415, when it certainly failed to justify the confidence of its
  votaries.</p>

  <p>The precise date when the golden fleurs-de-lys were added to the blue
  flag is open to doubt, but we find the form at a very early date, and
  from the first recognition of heraldic coats of arms this blazon was the
  accepted cognizance of the kings of France. We see this represented in
  Fig. <a href="#fig184">184</a>. Originally the fleurs-de-lys were
  powdered, as in Fig. <a href="#fig188">188</a>, over the whole surface,
  but in the reign of Charles V., <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1365, the
  number was reduced to three.<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The meaning of the fleur-de-lys has given rise to much controversy;
  some will tell us that it is a lily flower or an iris, while others
  affirm that it is a lance-head. Some authorities see in it an arbitrary
  floral form assumed by King Louis,<a name="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> and therefore the fleur-de-Louis; while
  others are so hard put to it that they tell us of a river Lys in Flanders
  that was so notable for its profusion of yellow iris that the flower
  became known as the fleur-de-Lys. The ancient chronicles gravely record
  that they were lilies brought from Paradise by an angel to King Clovis in
  the year 496, on the eve of a great battle fought near Cologne. Clovis
  made a vow that if he were victorious he would embrace the Christian
  faith, and the angel visitant and the celestial gift were a proof that
  his prayers were heard and his vow accepted. As the belief that France
  was in an especial degree under Divine protection was a very flattering
  one, the lilies were held for centuries in great favour; and the
  fleur-de-lys did not finally disappear from the flag of France until the
  downfall of Louis Philippe in the year 1848, a date within the
  recollection, doubtless, of some of our readers. Finality, indeed, may
  not even yet have been reached in the matter. As the bees of Napoleon I.
  reappeared in the arms of Napoleon III., so the fleur-de-lys may yet
  again appear on the ensigns of France. By virtue of a Napoleonic decree
  in 1852 against factious or treasonable emblems, it was forbidden to
  introduce the fleur-de-lys in jewellery, tapestry, or any other
  decorative way, lest its introduction might peril the position of a <!--
  Page 107 --><span class="pagenum" title="118.png"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>sovereign who rose to power by lavish
  bribery, and the free outpouring of blood. Napoleon the First, and at
  least by contrast the Great, when at Auch enquired the reason why many of
  the windows of the cathedral were partially concealed by paper, and he
  was informed that it was because it was feared that he would be offended
  at the sight of certain ancient emblems there represented. "What!" he
  exclaimed, "the fleurs-de-lys? Uncover them this moment. During eight
  centuries they guided the French to glory, as my eagles do now, and they
  must always be dear to France and held in reverence by her true
  children."</p>

  <p>The white cross frequently appears on the early French flags. Fig. <a
  href="#fig188">188</a>, the flag of the French Guards in the year 1563,
  is a good example of this. We find Favyn, in a book published in Paris in
  1620, "Le Théâtre d'honneur et de Chevalerie," writing: "Le grand
  estendard de satin bleu celeste en riche broderie de fleurs de lys d'or a
  une grande croix plein de satin blanc, qui est la croix de France." Figs.
  <a href="#fig180">180</a> and <a href="#fig181">181</a> are taken from a
  MS. executed in the time of Louis XII., <span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  1498, illustrating a battle scene; these two flags are placed by the side
  of the fleur-de-lys flag, Fig. <a href="#fig184">184</a>. When Louis XI.,
  in 1479, organised the national infantry we find him giving them as the
  national ensign a scarlet flag with white cross on it; and some two
  hundred years later we find the various provincial levies beneath flags
  of various designs and colours, but all agreeing in having the white
  cross as the leading feature. Fig. <a href="#fig182">182</a>, for
  example, is that of the Soissonois. Desjardins, in his excellent book on
  the French flag,<a name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> gives
  a great many illustrations of these. In the Musée d'Artillerie in Paris
  we find a very valuable collection of martial equipments from the time of
  Charlemagne, and amongst these a fine series (original where possible,
  or, failing this copies) of the flags of France from the year 1250.</p>

  <p>The Huguenot party in France adopted the white flag, and when King
  Henry III., 1574 to 1589, himself a Protestant, came to the throne, the
  white flag became the royal ensign, and was fully adopted in the next
  reign, that of Henry IV., the first king of the house of Bourbon, as the
  national flag. The whole history of the flag prior to the Great
  Revolution, is somewhat confused, and in the year 1669, which we may
  consider about the middle of the Bourbon or white flag period,<a
  name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> we find the order given
  by the <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum" title="119.png"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>Minister of the Marine that "the ensigns
  are to be blue, powdered with yellow fleurs-de-lys, with a large white
  cross in the middle." Merchant ships were to wear the same flag as the
  ships of war except that in the canton corner was to be placed the device
  of their province or town. Before the end of the year a new order was
  issued to the effect that "the ensigns at the stern are to be in all
  cases white," while the merchants were to fly the white flag with the
  device of the port in the corner. The white flag was sometimes plain, as
  in Fig. <a href="#fig183">183</a>, and at other times provided with
  yellow fleurs-de-lys. On the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, after
  the Republic, Consulate, and Empire, the white flag was again the flag of
  the nation, and remained so until 1830, its last appearance in France,
  unless or until the house of Bourbon again arises to the throne, when the
  restoration of the <i>drapeau blanc</i> would probably follow. The white
  flag has therefore been the national ensign of France for over two
  hundred years.</p>

  <p>In a book in the library of the Science and Art Department, South
  Kensington, we found the flag represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig185">185</a> figured as the French Standard, with Fig. <a
  href="#fig187">187</a> apparently as an alternative, while the National
  flag of France is represented as the tricolor with bordering shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig189">189</a>, and the Admiral's flag is given as pure
  white. The book is entitled "A Display of Naval Flags of all Nations." It
  was published in Liverpool; no date is given, but we can arrive
  approximately at this, as the British Standard is represented as
  including the arms of Hanover; this limits its publication to between the
  years 1714 and 1837.</p>

  <p>The well-known tricolor of France, Fig. <a href="#fig191">191</a>,
  dates from the era of the Revolution and came into existence in 1789. It
  has, with the exception of the short Bourbon Restoration, been the flag
  of France for over a century, and it remains so to this day, though it
  underwent some few modifications ere it settled down to the present form.
  Thus, for instance, on October 24th 1790, it was decreed that the colour
  next the staff was to be red, the central strip white and the outer blue,
  but on February 15th, 1794, it was ordered that "the flag prescribed by
  the National Assembly be abolished. The national flag shall be formed of
  the three national colours in equal bands placed vertically, the hoist
  being blue, the centre white, and the fly red." On the Revolution of
  1848, the provisional government ordered on March 5th that the colours
  were to run thus&mdash;blue, red, white, but the opposition to this was
  so strong that only two days later the order was cancelled. In 1790 the
  tricolor was made the Jack, and the ensign was as shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig190">190</a>. This ensign was to be common to both the
  men-of-war and the flags of the merchant navy, but the arrangement was
  not of long continuance. The spirit of change that was felt in every
  department affected the flags <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum" title="120.png"
  ><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>likewise, and some little time elapsed
  before the matter was satisfactorily settled.</p>

  <p>The arms of Paris are a white galley on a red ground, and above this
  are three golden fleurs-de-lys on a blue band or strip. On July 14th,
  1789, it was determined that a civic guard of forty thousand men should
  be raised, and that its colours should be those of the city, the gules
  and azure of the groundwork of the escutcheon, to which, on the proposal
  of Lafayette, the white of the royal <i>drapeau blanc</i> was added.</p>

  <p>During the first and second Empire the Imperial Standard was still the
  tricolor, but it bore in the centre of the white strip the eagle; and all
  three strips were richly diapered over with the golden bees of the
  Napoleons. The national flag was the tricolor pure and simple, both for
  the Imperial and the Commercial Navy. As the flags of the army were borne
  on staffs surmounted by a golden eagle, the term "eagle" was often
  applied to these colours.<a name="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the outbreak of the second Republic in 1848, the people immediately
  on its proclamation demanded the adoption of the ill-omened red flag.
  Lamartine, the leading member of the provisional Government, closed an
  impassioned address with the words: "Citizens, I will reject even to
  death this banner of blood, and you should repudiate it still more than
  myself, for this red flag you offer us has only made the circuit of the
  Champs de Mars bathed in the blood of the people, while the tricolor has
  made the circuit of the world, with the name, the glory, and the liberty
  of your country." Louis Blanc and other members of the Government were in
  favour of the red flag, and at last a compromise was effected and the
  tricolor was accepted with the addition of a large red rosette. Louis
  Blanc, not unreasonably, as a Republican, pointed out that Lafayette had
  in 1789 associated the white of the Bourbon flag with the red and blue of
  the arms of the City, and that the tricolor flag was therefore the result
  of a compromise between the king and the people, but that in 1848 the
  king having abdicated, and monarchy done away with, there was no reason
  why any suggestion of the kingly power should continue. Doubtless the
  suppression of the flag of the barricades, the symbol of civil strife,
  <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum" title="121.png"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>of anarchy and bloodshed, and the
  retaining of the tricolor was the wiser and more patriotic course, though
  it required no mean amount of courage and strong personal influence to
  effect the change.</p>

  <p>The Imperial Eagle, so long a symbol of victory, has now in these
  Republican days<a name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
  disappeared from the national colours. The flag of the French army is now
  surmounted by a wreath of laurel traversed by a golden dart with the
  letters R.F. and the regimental number, while on one face of the flag
  itself is, in the middle, the inscription "Republique Française, Honneur
  et Patrie," each corner being occupied by a golden wreath enclosing the
  number of the regiment. The name of the regiment and its "honours" occupy
  the other side.</p>

  <p>The pendant of the French man-of-war is simply, Fig. <a
  href="#fig186">186</a>, the tricolor elongated. The Admiral flies a
  swallow-tailed tricolor, while the Rear-Admiral and the Vice-Admiral have
  flags of the ordinary shape, like Fig. <a href="#fig191">191</a>, except
  that the former officer has two white stars on the blue strip near the
  top of it, and the latter three. Maritime prefects have the three white
  stars on the blue plus two crossed anchors in blue in the centre of the
  white strip. The Governor of a French colony has such a special and
  distinctive flag as Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a> would be if, instead of
  the Union canton on the blue, we placed in similar place the tricolor.
  There are naturally a great many other official flags, but the
  requirements of our space forbid our going into any further description
  of them.</p>

  <p>The war and mercantile flags of Spain have undergone many changes, and
  their early history is very difficult to unravel; but on May 28th, 1785,
  the flags were adopted that have continued in use ever since. Fig. <a
  href="#fig192">192</a> is the flag of the Spanish Navy; it consists, as
  will be seen, of three stripes&mdash;a central yellow one, and a red one,
  somewhat narrower, above and below. The original proportion was that the
  yellow should be equal in width to the two red ones combined. This
  central stripe is charged, near the hoist, with an escutcheon containing
  the arms of Castile and Leon, and surmounted by the royal crown. The
  mercantile flag, Fig. <a href="#fig193">193</a>, is also red and yellow.
  The yellow stripe in the centre is without the escutcheon, and in width
  it should be equal to one-third of the entire depth of the flag, the
  remaining thirds above and below it being divided into two equal strips,
  the one red and the other yellow. This simple striping of the two colours
  was doubtless <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum" title="122.png"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span>suggested by the arms of Arragon, the
  vertical red and yellow bars<a name="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> of which may be seen also in the
  Spanish Royal Standard, Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>. Spain, like
  Italy, has grown into one monarchy by the aggregation of minor States. In
  the year 1031 we have the Union of Navarre and Castile; in 1037 we find
  Leon and Asturias joining this same growing kingdom, and in the year 1474
  Ferdinand II. of Arragon married Isabella of Castile, and thus united
  nearly the whole of the Christian part of Spain into one monarchy. In
  1492 this same prince added to his dominions Moorish Spain by the
  conquest of Granada.</p>

  <p>Legend hath it that in the year 873 the Carlovingian Prince Charles
  the Bold honoured Geoffrey, Count of Barcelona, by dipping his four
  fingers in the blood from the Count's wounds after a battle in which they
  were allied, and drawing them down the Count's golden shield, and that
  these ruddy bars were then and there incorporated in the blazon.
  Barcelona was shortly afterwards merged into the kingdom of Arragon, and
  its arms were adopted as those of that kingdom. Its four upright strips
  of red, the marks of the royal fingers, are just beyond the upper shield
  in Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>.</p>

  <p>The pendant of the Spanish Navy bears at its broad end a golden space
  in which the arms and crown, as in Fig. <a href="#fig192">192</a>, are
  placed; the rest of the streamer is a broad strip of yellow, bordered, as
  in Fig. <a href="#fig192">192</a>, by two slightly narrower strips of
  red.</p>

  <p>The Royal Standard of Spain, Fig. <a href="#fig194">194</a>, is of
  very elaborate character, and many of its bearings are as inappropriate
  to the historic facts of the present day as the retention in the arms of
  Great Britain of the French fleurs-de-lys centuries after all claim to
  its sovereignty had been lost. In the upper left hand part of the flag we
  find quartered the lion of Leon and the castle of Castile.<a
  name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> At the point we have
  marked "C" are the arms of Arragon. "D" is the device of Sicily. The red
  and white stripes at "E" are the arms of Austria; we have already
  encountered these in Fig. <a href="#fig213">213</a>. The flag of ancient
  Burgundy, oblique stripes of yellow and blue within a red border, is
  placed at "F." The black lion on the golden ground at "G" is the heraldic
  bearing of Flanders, while the red eagle "H" is the device of Antwerp. At
  "I" we have the <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum" title="123.png"><a
  name="page112"></a>{112}</span>golden lion of Brabant, and above it at
  "J" the fleurs-de-lys and chequers of ancient Burgundy. The upper small
  shield contains the arms of Portugal, and the lower contains the
  fleurs-de-lys of France.<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Portuguese were an independent nation until Philip II. of Spain
  overran the country, and annexed it in the year 1580 to his own
  dominions, but in the year 1640 they threw off the Spanish yoke, which
  had grown intolerable, and raised John, Duke of Braganza, to the throne.
  The regal power has ever since remained in this family.</p>

  <p>The Royal Standard bears on its scarlet field the arms of Portugal,
  surmounted by the regal crown. These arms were originally only the white
  shield with the five smaller escutcheons that we see in the centre of the
  present blazon. Would the scale of our illustration (Fig. <a
  href="#fig195">195</a>) permit it, each of these small escutcheons should
  bear upon its surface five white circular spots. Portugal was invaded by
  the Moors in the year 713, and the greater part of the country was held
  by them for over three centuries. In the year 1139 Alphonso I. defeated
  an alliance of five great Moorish princes at the Battle of Ourique, and
  the five escutcheons in the shield represents the five-fold victory,
  while the five circles placed on each escutcheon symbolise the five
  wounds of the Saviour in whose strength he defeated the infidels. The
  scarlet border with its castles was added by Alphonso III., after his
  marriage in 1252 with the daughter of Alphonso the Wise, King of Castile,
  the arms of which province, as we have already seen in discussing the
  Spanish Standard, are a golden castle on a red field.</p>

  <p>In an English poem, written by an eye-witness of the Siege of Rouen in
  the year 1418, we find an interesting reference to the arms of Portugal,
  where we read of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The Kyngis herandis and pursiuantis,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Portuguese ensign for her vessels of war and also for the merchant
  service bears the shield and crown, but instead of the <!-- Page 113
  --><span class="pagenum" title="124.png"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>scarlet field we find the groundwork of
  the flag half blue, and half white, as shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig196">196</a>. The choice of these special colours, no doubt,
  arose from the arms on the original shield, the five blue escutcheons on
  the white ground. The Portuguese Jack has the national arms and royal
  crown in the centre of a white field, the whole being surrounded by the
  broad border of blue.</p>

  <p>Italy, for centuries a geographical expression, is now one and
  indivisible. Within the recollection of many of our readers the peninsula
  was composed of the Kingdom of the two Sicilies, the Pontifical States,
  the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchies of Parma and Modena. There was
  also in the north the Kingdom of Sardinia, while Lombardy and Venetia
  were in the grip of Austria. It is somewhat beside our present purpose to
  go into the wonderful story of how Victor Emmanuel of Savoy, aided by
  Cavour, Garibaldi, and many another noble patriot, by diplomacy, by lives
  freely laid down on the Tchernaya, on the fields of Magenta and
  Solferino, by the disaster at Sedan, by bold audacity at one time, by
  patient waiting at another, was finally installed in Rome, the Capital of
  United Italy, as king of a great and free nation of over thirty millions
  of people. Suffice it now to say that this Kingdom of Italy, as we now
  know it, did not achieve until the year 1870 this full unity under one
  flag that had been for centuries the dream of patriots who freely shed
  their blood on the battlefield or the scaffold, or perished in the
  dungeons of Papal Rome, or Naples, or Austria for this ideal.</p>

  <p>On the downfall in 1861 of the Bourbon Government in the Kingdom of
  the two Sicilies before the onslaught of the Volunteers of Garibaldi, the
  first National Parliament met in Turin, and proclaimed Victor Emmanuel
  King of Italy. The title was at once acknowledged by Great Britain, and,
  later on, by the other Powers, and the capital of the rising State was
  transferred to Florence. The Papal States were still under the protection
  of France, "the eldest Son of the Church"; and the young Kingdom, unable
  to wrest Rome from the French, had to wait with such patience as it could
  command for the consummation of its hopes. The long-looked-for day at
  last arrived, when amidst the tremendous defeats inflicted in 1870 by
  Germany on France, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn, and the
  Italians, after a short, sharp conflict with the Papal troops, entered
  into possession of the Eternal City, and at once made it the Capital of a
  State at last free throughout its length and breadth&mdash;no longer a
  geographical expression, but a potent factor to be reckoned with and
  fully recognised.</p>

  <p>Napoleon I. formed Italy into one kingdom in the year 1805, but it was
  ruled by himself and the Viceroy, Eugene Beauharnois, he appointed; and
  on his overthrow this, like the various other political <!-- Page 114
  --><span class="pagenum" title="125.png"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>arrangements he devised, came to nought.
  The flag he bestowed was a tricolor of green, white, and red, his idea
  being that, while giving the new Kingdom a flag of its own, it should
  indicate by its near resemblance to that of France the source to which it
  owed its existence. In 1848, the great revolutionary period, this flag,
  which had passed out of existence on the downfall of Napoleon, was
  reassumed by the Nationalists of the Peninsula, and accepted by the King
  of Sardinia as the ensign of his own kingdom, and charged by him with the
  arms of Savoy. This tricolor, so charged (see Fig. <a
  href="#fig197">197</a>) was the flag to which the eyes of all Italian
  patriots turned, and it is to-day the flag of all Italy. The flag we have
  represented is the ensign of the Merchant Service; the flag of the armed
  forces military and naval, is similar, save that the shield in the centre
  is surmounted by the Royal Crown. The Royal Standard, the personal flag
  of the King, has the arms of Savoy in the centre, on a white ground, the
  whole having a broad bordering of blue.</p>

  <p>This shield of Savoy, the white cross on the red field, was the device
  of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, an order semi-religious,
  semi-military, that owed its origin to the Crusades. In the year 1310 the
  Knights captured Rhodes from the Saracens, but being hard pressed by the
  infidels, Duke Amadeus IV., of Savoy, came to the rescue, and the Grand
  Master of the Order conferred upon him the cross that has ever since been
  borne in the arms of Savoy. The Jack or bowsprit flag of the Italian
  man-of-war, Fig. <a href="#fig234">234</a>, is simply this shield of the
  Knights of St. John squared into suitable flag-like form.</p>

  <p>The Minister of Marine has the tricolor, but on the green portion is
  placed erect a golden anchor. The vessels carrying the Royal Mail fly a
  burgee of green, white, red, having a large white "P" on the green; and
  there are many other official flags, the insignia of various authorities
  or different departments, but lack of space forbids our dwelling at
  greater length upon them.</p>

  <p>The war flag of the defunct temporal power of the Pope was white, and
  in its centre stood figures of St. Peter and St. Paul, and above them the
  cross keys and tiara. Fig. <a href="#fig198">198</a> was the flag of the
  merchant ships owned by the subjects of the States of the Church. The
  combination of yellow and white is very curious. In the banner borne by
  Godfrey, the Crusader King of Jerusalem, the only tinctures introduced
  were the two metals, gold and silver, five golden crosses being placed
  upon a silver field. This was done of deliberate intention that it might
  be unlike all other devices, as it is in all other cases deemed false
  heraldry to place metal on metal. The theory that these metals were
  selected because of the reference in the Psalms to the Holy City, may
  also be a very possible one&mdash;"Though ye have lien amongst the pots,
  yet shall ye <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum" title="126.png"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>be as the wings of a dove covered with
  silver, and her feathers with yellow gold." However this may be, the
  yellow and white of the arms of Jerusalem was adopted by the Papal
  Government.</p>

  <p>The Danish flag is the oldest now in existence. In the year 1219, King
  Waldemar of Denmark in a critical moment in his stormy career, saw, or
  thought he saw, or said he saw, a cross in the sky. He was then leading
  his troops to battle against the Livonian pagans, and he gladly welcomed
  this answer to his prayers for Divine succour, this assurance of
  celestial aid. This sign from Heaven he forthwith adopted as the flag of
  his country, and called it the Dannebrog, <i>i.e.</i>, the strength of
  Denmark. As a definite chronological fact, apart from all legend, this
  flag dates from the thirteenth century. There was also an Order of
  Dannebrog instituted in 1219, in further commemoration and honour of the
  miracle; and the name is a very popular one in the Danish Royal Navy, one
  man-of-war after another succeeding to the appellation. One of these
  Dannebrogs was blown up by the fire of Nelson's fleet in 1801.</p>

  <p>The Danish Man-of-War Ensign is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig224">224</a>. The Royal Standard, like the Ensign, is
  swallow-tailed, but in the centre of the cross is placed a white square,
  indicated in our illustration, Fig. <a href="#fig224">224</a>, by dots.
  This central, square space contains the Royal Arms, surrounded by the
  Collars of the Orders of the Elephant and of the Dannebrog. The merchant
  flag, Fig. <a href="#fig225">225</a>, is rectangular.</p>

  <p>In the year 1397, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark all formed one kingdom
  under the rule of the latter, but in 1414 the Swedes waged with more or
  less success an arduous struggle for liberty, and their independence was
  definitely acknowledged in the year 1523. The flag of Sweden is the
  yellow cross on the blue ground shown in Fig. <a href="#fig231">231</a>.
  The blue and yellow are the colours of the Swedish arms,<a name="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> and they were then doubtless chosen for
  the flag as the colours of freedom and independence.</p>

  <p>Norway had no separate political existence until the year 1814, but in
  that year the Norwegians seceded from Denmark, and declared their
  independence. Their first flag was still a red flag with a white cross on
  it, and the arms of Norway in the upper corner next the flagstaff, but
  this being found to too closely resemble the Danish flag, they
  substituted for it the device seen in Fig. <a href="#fig230">230</a>,
  which it will be noted is still the Danish flag, plus the blue cross on
  the white one. The administration of Norway is entirely distinct from
  Sweden, and it retains its own laws, but in 1814 the two Kingdoms were
  united under one Sovereign. As a sign of the union there is carried in
  the upper square, next to the flagstaff in the flags of both countries, a
  union device, a combination of the Swedish <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="127.png"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>and
  Norwegian National colours. After considerable dispute, the Union Jack
  shown in Fig. <a href="#fig229">229</a> was accepted as the symbol of the
  political relationship of the two nations. It is a very neat arrangement,
  for if we look at the upper and lower portions we see the flag (Fig. <a
  href="#fig230">230</a>) of Norway, if we study the two lateral portions
  we find they are the flag (Fig. <a href="#fig231">231</a>) of Sweden.
  Both the Swedish and Norwegian war flags are swallow-tailed, and have the
  outer limb of the cross projecting; we may see this very clearly in Fig.
  <a href="#fig228">228</a>, where the main body of the flag is Norwegian.
  The merchant flag is with each nationality rectangular; in Fig. <a
  href="#fig227">227</a> we have the flag of a Swedish merchant vessel.
  Both in the Norwegian and Swedish flags, as we may note in Figs. <a
  href="#fig227">227</a> and <a href="#fig228">228</a>, it will be noticed
  that the Union device is conspicuously present. The Norwegian man-of-war
  flag, Fig. <a href="#fig228">228</a>, would be that of a Norwegian
  merchant if we cut off the points in the fly; the Swedish merchant flag,
  Fig. <a href="#fig227">227</a>, would be that of a Swedish man-of-war if
  instead of the straight end we made it swallow-tailed. As Sovereign of
  Sweden, the King places his arms in the centre of the large yellow cross;
  as Sovereign of Norway, in the centre of the large blue cross; hence we
  get the Swedish and Norwegian Royal Standards, the one for use in the one
  country, and the other for service in the other, the Union device being
  present in the upper corner in each case, and the outer portion of the
  flags swallow-tailed. The Standard is, in fact, the war flag plus the
  royal arms. The Post Service has in the centre of the flag a white
  square, with a golden horn and crown in it; the Customs flag has a
  similar white square at the junction of the arms of the cross, and in its
  centre is placed a crowned "T."</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig232">232</a>, on the same sheet as the flags of
  Norway and Sweden, is the simple and beautiful flag of Switzerland. Like
  the crosses of St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, or that on the flag
  of Denmark, its device has a religious significance. Gautier tells us
  that:&mdash;"La première fois qu'il en est fait mention dans l'histoire
  écrite est dans la Chronique du Bearnois Justinger. Il dit, après avoir
  fait l'énumération des forces des Suisses quittant Berne pour marcher
  contre l'armée des nobles coalisés en 1339&mdash;'Et tous étaient marqués
  au signe de la Sainte Croix, une croix blanche dans un écusson rouge, par
  la raison que l'affranchissement de la nation était pour eux une cause
  aussi sacrée que la délivrance des lieux saints.'"</p>

  <p>Its twenty-two cantons are united by a Constitution, under one
  President and one flag, but each canton has its own cantonal colours.
  Thus Basel is half black and half white; St. Gallen, green and white;
  Geneva, red and yellow; Aargau, black and blue; Glarus, red, black, and
  white; Uri, yellow and black; Berne, black and red; Fribourg, black and
  white; Lucerne, blue and white; <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum" title="128.png"
  ><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>Tessin, red and blue; and so forth. In
  each case the stripes of colour are disposed horizontally, and the one we
  have each time mentioned first is the upper colour.</p>

  <p>Within the walls of the City of Geneva was held, in 1863, an
  International Conference, to consider how far the horrors of war could be
  mitigated by aid to the sick and wounded. This Conference proposed that
  in time of war the neutrality should be fully admitted of field and
  stationary hospitals, and also recognised in the most complete manner by
  the belligerent Powers in the case of all officials employed in sanitary
  work, volunteer nurses, the inhabitants of the country who shall assist
  the wounded, and the wounded themselves&mdash;that an identical
  distinctive sign should be adopted for the medical corps of all armies,
  and that an identical flag should be used for all hospitals and
  ambulances, and for all houses containing wounded men. The distinctive
  mark of all such refuges is a white flag with a red cross on it&mdash;the
  flag of Switzerland reversed in colouring&mdash;and all medical stores,
  carriages, and the like, bear the same device upon them; while the
  doctors, nurses, and assistants, have a white armlet with the red cross
  upon it, the sacred badge that proclaims their mission of mercy. In
  deference to the religious feelings of Turkey a red crescent may be
  substituted for the cross in campaigns where that country is one of the
  belligerents. These valuable proposals were confirmed by a treaty in
  August, 1864, signed by the representatives of twelve Powers, and known
  as the Geneva Convention. Since then all the civilised Powers in the
  world, with the exception of the United States, have given in their
  adhesion to it. In 1867 an International Conference was held at Paris for
  still further developing and carrying out in a practical manner the
  principles of the Geneva Conference, and another at Berlin in 1869 for
  the same object. One notable feature of these two Conferences was the
  extension of the principles accepted for land conflict to naval
  warfare.</p>

  <p>Holland, as an Independent State, came into existence in the year
  1579. From 1299 we find the country under the rule of the Courts of
  Hainault, and in 1436 it came into the hands of the Dukes of Burgundy,
  who in turn were subjugated by the Spaniards. The tyranny and religious
  persecution to which the Netherlanders were exposed by the Spaniards led
  to numerous revolts, which at last developed into a War of Independence,
  under William, Prince of Orange. The Hollanders adopted as their flag the
  colours of the House of Orange&mdash;orange, white, and blue. At first
  there was great latitude of treatment, the number of the bars of each
  colour and their order being very variable, but in 1599 it was definitely
  fixed that the flag of the Netherlands was to be orange, white, blue, in
  three horizontal stripes of equal width. How the orange became <!-- Page
  118 --><span class="pagenum" title="129.png"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>changed to red is very doubtful; Fournier,
  writing in 1643, we see refers to the Dutch flag as a tricolor of red,
  white, blue.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig237">237</a> represents the Royal Standard of
  Holland; the army and navy and commercial flags are similar, except that
  the Royal Arms are not introduced.</p>

  <p>During the general effervescence caused by the French Revolution, the
  naval flag of Holland had in the upper staff-corner a white canton,
  charged with a figure of Liberty, but the innovation was not at all
  popular, as the sailors preferred the old tricolor under which the great
  victories of Reuter and Van Tromp were gained, and in 1806 it was deemed
  expedient to revert to it.</p>

  <p>The brilliant scarlet, yellow, and black tricolor represented in Fig.
  <a href="#fig236">236</a> is the flag of Belgium. The Standard has, in
  addition, the Royal Arms placed in the centre of the yellow strip. The
  black, yellow, and red, are the colours of the Duchy of Brabant, and
  these were adopted as the national flag in 1831.</p>

  <p>From 1477 onwards we find Belgium under Austrian domination, and in
  1566 it fell into the hands of Spain. In 1795, and for some years
  following, it was held by France, and in 1814 was handed over to the
  Prince of Orange, but in 1830 the Belgians rose against the Hollanders,
  and before the end of the year their independence was acknowledged by the
  Great Powers, and Leopold of Coburg, in the following year, became first
  King of Belgium. Within a month of his accession to the throne, the Dutch
  recommenced the struggle, and it was only in 1839 that a final treaty of
  peace was signed in London between Belgium and Holland, and its claims to
  independence frankly recognised by the Dutch.</p>

  <p>Greece, originally invaded by the Turks in the year 1350, remained for
  nearly five hundred years under their oppressive yoke, rising from time
  to time against their masters, only to expose their country, on the
  failure of their attempts, to the greater tyranny and the most dreadful
  excesses. Over ten thousand Greeks were slaughtered in Cyprus in 1821,
  while the bombardment of Scio in 1822, and the horrible massacre on its
  capture, stand out in lurid colours as one of the most atrocious deeds
  the world has ever known: over forty thousand men, women, and children
  fell by the sword. Seven thousand who had fled to the mountains were
  induced to surrender by a promise of amnesty, and these, too, were
  murdered. The towns and villages were fired, and the unfortunate
  inhabitants, hemmed in by the Turks, perished in the flames or fell
  beneath the swords of their relentless foes if they attempted to escape.
  Small wonder, then, that the heart of Europe was stirred, and that Lord
  Byron and thousands more took up the cause of Greek independence, by
  contributions of arms and money, by fiery denunciation, and with strong
  right hand. Missolonghi, Navarino, <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum" title="130.png"
  ><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span>and many another scene of struggle we
  cannot here dwell upon, suffice it to say that at last the victory was
  won and Greece emerged, after a tremendous struggle, from the bondage of
  the Turks, and took its place in Europe as a free and independent nation,
  the Porte acknowledging the inexorable logic of the <i>fait accompli</i>
  on April 25th, 1830. After a short Presidency under one of the Greek
  nobles, Otho of Bavaria was elected King of Greece in 1833, and the new
  Kingdom was fairly launched.</p>

  <p>The Greeks adopted the blue and white, the colours of Bavaria, as a
  delicate compliment to the Prince who accepted their invitation to ascend
  the throne of Greece. The merchant flag of Greece is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig233">233</a>. It will be seen that it consists of nine stripes,
  alternately blue and white, the canton being blue, with a white cross in
  it. The navy flag is similar, except that in addition there is placed a
  golden crown in the centre of the cross. The Royal Standard is blue with
  a white cross; the arms of the cross are not, as in Fig. <a
  href="#fig233">233</a>, of equal length, but the one next the staff is
  shorter, as in the Danish flag, Fig. <a href="#fig225">225</a>. In the
  open space at the crossing of the arms is placed the Royal Arms.</p>

  <p>The Turkish Empire has undergone many changes and vicissitudes, and
  has in these latter days shrunk considerably. European Turkey now
  consists of about seventy thousand square miles, while Turkey in Asia,
  Syria, Asia Minor, Palestine, Armenia, etc., is over seven hundred
  thousand.<a name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The crescent moon and star, Figs. <a href="#fig239">239</a> and <a
  href="#fig240">240</a>, were adopted by the Turks as their device on the
  capture of Constantinople by Mahomet II., in 1453. They were originally
  the symbol of Diana, the Patroness of Byzantium, and were adopted by the
  Ottomans as a badge of triumph. Prior to that event, the crescent was a
  very common charge in the armorial bearings of English Knights, but it
  fell into considerable disuse when it became the special device of the
  Mohamedans, though even so late as the year 1464 we find René, Duke of
  Anjou, founding an Order of Knighthood having as its badge the crescent
  moon, encircled by a motto signifying "praise by increasing." Though the
  crescent was, as we have seen, originally a Pagan symbol, it remained
  throughout the rise and development of the Greek Church the special mark
  of Constantinople, and even now in Moscow and other Russian cities the
  <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum" title="131.png"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>crescent and the cross may be seen
  combined on the churches, the object being to indicate the Byzantine
  origin of the Russian Church.</p>

  <p>The crescent may be seen on the coins and medals of Augustus, Trajan,
  and other Emperors. The origin of the symbol was as follows: Philip, the
  father of Alexander the Great, meeting with many unforeseen difficulties
  in carrying on the siege of the city, set the soldiers to work one dark
  night to undermine the walls, but the crescent moon appearing the design
  was discovered and the scheme miscarried; and in acknowledgment the
  Byzantines erected a statue to Diana, and made the crescent
  moon&mdash;the attribute of the Goddess&mdash;the symbol of their
  city.</p>

  <p>The War Flag of Turkey is the crescent and star on the scarlet field,
  as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig239">239</a>. The flag of the Merchant
  Service seems less definitely fixed. In the Official Flag Book<a
  name="NtA_79" href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> of the English Admiralty,
  Fig. <a href="#fig239">239</a> is given as both the man-of-war flag and
  the merchant flag for Turkey, Egypt, and Tripoli, while in an excellent
  book on the subject, published at Vienna in 1883, Fig. <a
  href="#fig235">235</a> is given as the flag of the commercial marine; and
  we have also seen a plain red flag with a star in the upper corner of the
  hoist, and another divided into three horizontal bands, the upper and
  lower being red, and the central one green.</p>

  <p>The Military and Naval Service of Tunis has the flag represented in
  Fig. <a href="#fig240">240</a>, while the Tunisian commercial flag is
  simply red, without device of any kind.</p>

  <p>In a map bearing the date 1502 the Turkish Dominions are marked by a
  scarlet flag having three points and bearing three black crescents, while
  in a sheet of flags with the comparatively modern date of 1735, "Turk" is
  represented by a blue flag with three crescents in white upon it.</p>

  <p>The personal flag of the Sultan, corresponding to our Royal Standard,
  is scarlet, and bears in its centre the device of the reigning sovereign:
  hence it undergoes a change at each accession to the throne. This device,
  known as the Tughra, is placed on the coinage, postal stamps, etc., as
  well as on the Royal Flag, and consists of the name of the Sultan, the
  title Khan, and the epithet <i>El muzaffar daima</i>, signifying the
  ever-victorious. The history of the Tughra is curious: When Sultan Murad
  I. entered into a treaty of peace with the Ragusans, he was not
  sufficiently scholarly to be able to affix <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="132.png"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span>his
  signature to the document, so he wetted his open hand with ink and
  pressed it on the paper, the first, second, and third fingers making
  smears in fairly close proximity, while the thumb and fourth finger were
  apart on either side. Within the mark thus made, the Ottoman Scribes
  wrote the name of Murad, his title, and the epithet that bore testimony
  to his ever-victorious career. The Tughra remains the symbol of this, the
  three upright forms being the three fingers of Murad, the rounded line to
  the left the thumb, and the line to the right the little finger; these
  leading forms do not vary, but the smaller characters change with the
  change of sovereign. This Murad, sometimes called Amurath, ascended the
  throne in the year 1362.<a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The personal flag of the Khedive of Egypt is green, and has in its
  centre the crescent and three white stars.</p>

  <p>By the Treaty of Berlin, July 1878, the provinces of Moldavia and
  Wallachia, formerly a portion of the Turkish Empire, and the territory of
  the Dobrudscha, were recognised as an independent State, and were formed
  into the kingdom of Roumania somewhat later, the sovereign who had
  previously held the rank of prince being crowned king in March, 1881. The
  flag of Roumania is the brilliant blue, yellow and red tricolor shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig242">242</a>.</p>

  <p>The flag of Servia, another small kingdom of Eastern Europe, is shown
  in Fig. <a href="#fig243">243</a>; the royal standard is similar, except
  that the arms are placed in the centre of the blue stripe. It will be
  seen that the flag of Servia is that of Russia, Fig. <a
  href="#fig218">218</a>, reversed. By the Berlin Treaty of 1878, Servia
  received a large increase of territory, and was created an independent
  State, its princely ruler being crowned king in March, 1882.</p>

  <p>The State of Bulgaria is another of the creations of the Berlin
  Treaty. It is governed by a prince who is nominally under the suzerainty
  of Turkey. Its war flag is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig241">241</a>; the
  mercantile flag has no leonine canton, but is simply a tricolor of white,
  green, and red.</p>

  <p>Having already dealt with the United States, we propose now to turn
  our attention to the other Governments of the New World. The simple and
  effective ensign of Chili is represented in Fig. <a
  href="#fig161">161</a>. This flag is used both by the Chilian men-of-war
  and by the vessels of the mercantile marine. Fig. <a
  href="#fig157">157</a> is so much of the pendant of a man-of-war as the
  limits of our page will permit. The Chilian Jack is the blue canton and
  white star of Fig. <a href="#fig161">161</a>, treated as a distinct <!--
  Page 122 --><span class="pagenum" title="133.png"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>flag, and the flags of the various naval
  ranks are also blue with a varying number of white stars.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig164">164</a> is the merchant flag of New Granada;
  the Government ensign has in addition the shield of arms in the centre of
  the blue stripe. It will be observed that the colours in this tricolor
  are the same as those of Roumania, Fig. <a href="#fig242">242</a>, only
  differently disposed. New Granada is composed of nine small States, and
  in 1863 these bound themselves into a closer confederation, and changed
  their collective name from New Granada to that of the United States of
  Colombia, and adopted a tricolor of yellow, blue, and red, only disposed
  horizontally instead of as in Fig. <a href="#fig164">164</a>, vertically.
  This sounds identical with the flag of Venezuela, but in the centre of
  the Colombian flag is placed a different device, and the yellow stripe
  takes up half the space, the other two being only half its width. Fig. <a
  href="#fig165">165</a> is the flag of Uruguay, a State that was formerly
  a province of Brazil, but declared its independence in the year 1825. The
  next flag on our plate, Fig. <a href="#fig166">166</a>, is the war ensign
  of Guatemala: the shield in the centre bears a scroll with the words
  "Libertad 15 de Setiembre, 1821," surmounted by a parrot, surrounded by a
  wreath, and having behind it crossed rifles and swords. The merchant flag
  is the plain blue, white, blue, without the shield. In the year 1525 the
  country was conquered by Don Pedro de Alvarado, one of the companions of
  Cortes, and it remained subject to Spain until 1821, when it gained its
  independence, the "Libertad" of the scroll. It then went in vigorously
  for several years of civil war, and the outcome of this was that the
  country known under Spanish rule as Guatemala, a country embracing all
  Central America, split up in 1839 into five Republics, all absolutely
  independent of each other, viz., Guatemala, San Salvador, Honduras,
  Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.</p>

  <p>The next flag, Fig. <a href="#fig167">167</a>, is the ensign of Costa
  Rica: the one represented is that of the Merchant Service. The war ensign
  differs from it in having in the centre the arms of the State, surrounded
  on either side by a trophy of three flags, and beneath all a wreath. Fig.
  <a href="#fig168">168</a>, the flag of Paraguay, is very suggestive of
  the colours of Holland, though the device in the centre serves to
  differentiate it. Paraguay is the only State in America that has no
  sea-board, and therefore no Mercantile Marine.</p>

  <p>Brazil, discovered by the Portuguese in 1500, remained in their
  possession until a revolutionary struggle in the year 1821 ended in
  favour of the Brazilians, when an Empire was shortly afterwards
  established. Compared to the other States of South America, it has passed
  through long periods of rest and prosperity, but of late years its
  political position has been one of considerable uncertainty, the Emperor
  having been dismissed and the rival <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="134.png"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>ambitions for the Presidentship leading to
  civil war. These political changes have necessarily produced
  modifications in the flag. The present flag, Fig. <a
  href="#fig169">169</a>, is not altogether unlike that of the late Empire,
  though in this latter case the yellow diamond on the green ground held a
  shield and Imperial crown, flanked by sprays of coffee and tobacco. In
  the present flag this yellow diamond has a blue sphere spotted over with
  stars and a white band running across it, that bears in blue letters the
  legend <i>Ordem e progresso</i>.<a name="NtA_81"
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> Fig. <a href="#fig173">173</a> is the
  upper portion of the man-of-war pendant, a blue ground with white stars.
  Fig. <a href="#fig169">169</a> is the ensign, both of the War and
  Merchant Navy of Brazil.</p>

  <p>The yellow, blue, and red tricolor, Fig. <a href="#fig170">170</a>, is
  the merchant ensign of Venezuela; the war flag has the same stripes, and
  in addition the shield of the arms of the State is placed on the yellow
  band at the staff corner. When the Spaniards arrived off the coast in the
  year 1499, they found on landing that some of the native Indians were
  living in huts built on piles, hence they called the country Venezuela,
  or little Venice.</p>

  <p>Bolivia, formerly comprised in the Spanish Vice-Royalty of Colombia,
  derives its present name from Simon Bolivar, the leader of the revolution
  that gained it its freedom. Its commercial flag is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig171">171</a>; the war flag only differs in having the arms of
  the State placed in the centre of the red strip.</p>

  <p>The familiar green, white, red of Italy is repeated in the flag of
  Mexico, but instead of the cross of Savoy, we have the eagle and serpent.
  The Mexican merchant ensign is the plain tricolor of green, white, red,
  the central device we see in Fig. <a href="#fig172">172</a> marking it as
  the war flag. Mexico was discovered in 1518, and conquered, with infamous
  cruelties, by Cortes. After a lengthened revolutionary struggle, the yoke
  of Spain was finally thrown off in 1829, and the independence of Mexico
  was recognised by all the great European Powers.</p>

  <p>Peru was discovered by the Spaniards in 1513, and was soon afterwards,
  under the command of Pizarro, added to the dominions of the King of
  Spain. Peru remained in subjection to the Spaniards (who murdered the
  Incas and all their descendants, and committed the most frightful
  cruelties) until 1826, when the independence of the country, after a
  prolonged struggle, was completely achieved. The Peruvian war ensign is
  given in Fig. <a href="#fig174">174</a>, the merchant flag being the
  plain red, white, red.</p>

  <p>San Salvador, the smallest of the Central American Republics, <!--
  Page 124 --><span class="pagenum" title="135.png"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>established itself in 1839, on the
  break-up of the Spanish State of Guatemala. Its flag is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig175">175</a>.</p>

  <p>The country now held by the Argentine Republic was discovered in 1517,
  and settled by the Spaniards in 1553. The war ensign is represented in
  Fig. <a href="#fig176">176</a>; the merchant ensign has the three
  stripes, but the golden sun is missing.</p>

  <p>The Government of Ecuador has Fig. <a href="#fig177">177</a> as its
  war flag, the merchant ensign being without the ring of white stars. The
  last flag on the sheet (Fig. <a href="#fig178">178</a>) is the merchant
  flag of Haiti; the Government flag has the blue and red reduced to a
  broad border, the central portion of the flag being white. In the centre
  of this white portion stands a palm tree, and below it a trophy of arms
  and flags, flanked on either side by a cannon.</p>

  <p>The flag of the Cuban national forces in conflict with Spain has at
  the hoist a triangular portion of blue, one side of this triangle being
  the depth of the flag itself, and on this blue field is a white,
  five-pointed star. The rest of the flag is made up of the following
  horizontal and equal stripes&mdash;red, white, red, white, red.</p>

  <p>Japan&mdash;known to the Japanese as Niphon, derived from
  <i>Nitsu</i>, Sun, and <i>Phon</i>, the rising&mdash;the Land of the
  Rising Sun,<a name="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> has adopted
  this rising sun as its emblem. Japan claims to possess a written history
  of over 2,500 years, but the fairly authentic portion begins with the
  year 660 B.C., when the present hereditary succession of rulers
  commenced. English merchants visited Japan in 1612, and the Portuguese
  almost a century before. By 1587 the converts of the Portuguese Jesuit
  Missions numbered some six hundred thousand. At this time some Spanish
  Franciscans appeared on the scene, and political and religious discord
  soon followed. The Japanese ruler took alarm at the Papal claim to
  universal sovereignty, and the Buddhist Priesthood and the English and
  Dutch Protestant traders fanned the flame of suspicion and jealousy. This
  was done so effectually that the Japanese Government banished all
  foreigners, and closed the country against them. This state of things
  lasted for over two centuries, and it was only in the year 1853 that
  Japan was re-opened to the outside world. The flag of Japan, the rising
  sun, is represented in Fig. <a href="#fig244">244</a>. The red ball
  without the rays is used as a Jack, in which case it is placed in the
  centre of the white field. Fig. <a href="#fig245">245</a> is the Standard
  of the Emperor. The chrysanthemum is the emblem of Japan, and its golden
  flower, somewhat conventionally rendered it must be admitted, is the form
  we see introduced in Fig. <a href="#fig245">245</a>.<a name="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> Figs. <a href="#fig246">246</a> and <a
  href="#fig248">248</a> are the transport flag and the guard flag
  respectively of the Japanese war marine. <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="136.png"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span></p>

  <p>The Imperial Standard of China is yellow with a blue dragon. The
  official flag book of the Admiralty gives the flag of a Chinese Admiral
  as made up of the following horizontal stripes: yellow, white, black,
  green, red, a blue dragon on a white ground being the canton in the
  staff-head corner. The merchant ensign is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig247">247</a>. Amongst the Chinese flags captured in 1841, and
  preserved in the Royal United Service Institution, is one with a blue
  centre with an inscription in white upon it, and with a broad notched
  border of white; another has its centre of a pale blue and a darker blue
  dragon upon it, the whole being surrounded by a broad and deeply-notched
  border of red.</p>

  <p>The flag of Siam is scarlet with a white elephant thereon. Before
  Xacca, the founder of the nation, was born his mother dreamt that she
  brought forth a white elephant, and the Brahmins affirm that Xacca, after
  a metempsychosis of eighty thousand changes, concluded his very varied
  experiences as this white elephant, and thence was received into the
  company of the Celestial Deities. On this account the white elephant is
  held a sacred beast, and the Siamese rejoice to place themselves beneath
  so potent a protector. The flag of Korea bears the tiger. In the
  thickly-wooded glens of the interior, the royal tiger is found in
  formidable numbers.</p>

  <p>The flag of Sarawak, a territory of some forty thousand square miles,
  on the north-west of Borneo, is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig252">252</a>.
  The Government was obtained in 1842 from the Sultan of Borneo by an
  Englishman, Sir James Brooke, and it is still ruled by one of the family,
  a nephew of the first Rajah.</p>

  <p>In Africa, the only flags that we need particularize are those of the
  Orange Free State, Liberia, the Congo State, and the South African
  Republic.</p>

  <p>The Orange Free State was founded by Dutch emigrants from the Cape of
  Good Hope. It was proclaimed British territory in 1848, but by a
  Convention entered into in 1854, the inhabitants were declared to be "to
  all intents and purposes, a free and independent people, and their
  Government to be treated thenceforth as a free and independent
  Government." The flag, Fig. <a href="#fig249">249</a>, is the only one
  that has orange in it, clearly in allusion to the name of the State,
  while the canton of red, white, and blue, equally shows the pride of the
  people in their Dutch origin.</p>

  <p>The flag of the Independent Negro Republic of Liberia, is shown in
  Fig. <a href="#fig250">250</a>. The population largely consists of freed
  slaves, emigrants from America and their descendants, plus the
  aborigines. The flag, it will be seen, even to the thirteen stripes, is
  largely based on that of the United States, though one would have thought
  that that would have been about the last thing they would have selected.
  <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum" title="137.png"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span></p>

  <p>The Congo Free State in Central Africa was established in 1885 by the
  King of the Belgians; its flag is the golden star on the blue ground that
  we see in Fig. <a href="#fig251">251</a>, a device at once simple,
  expressive and pleasing.</p>

  <p>In 1840, a number of Dutch Boers, dissatisfied with the Government of
  Cape Colony, established themselves in Natal, where their treatment of
  the natives was so unjustifiable that a general rising was imminent, and
  the British Government was compelled to interfere, and itself take charge
  of the district. This the Boers resented, so they crossed the Vaal and
  established themselves afresh in the wilderness. In 1854, the British
  Government recognised the Transvaal or South African Republic, and in
  1881 a fresh Convention was agreed to by which the Boers were confirmed
  in full possession of the land, subject to the recognition of the British
  suzerainty. The flag of the Transvaal Government is shown in Fig. <a
  href="#fig253">253</a>.</p>

  <p>Now have we journeyed the whole world over and found in every land the
  emblems of nationality and patriotism. Unfamiliar as many of these may
  appear to us, they each represent a symbol endeared to thousands or
  hundreds of thousands of hearts, and thus are they full of warm human
  interest. For these various strips of gaily-coloured bunting, men have
  given without hesitation their lives, have poured out blood and treasure
  without stint or count of cost, and wherever they encounter them the wide
  world over, the wanderers forget for a while the alien shore or waste of
  ocean as their thoughts turn to the dear homeland.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We propose in this, our final chapter, to deal with the use of flags
  as a means of signalling; a branch of the subject by no means wanting
  either in interest or in practical value.</p>

  <p>The flags used for army signalling are only two in number if we
  consider their design, though, as each of these is made in two sizes, the
  actual outfit consists of four flags. The large size is three feet
  square, and the smaller is two feet square; the larger sizes are clearly
  more visible, but on the other hand the smaller save weight and
  consequently labour; and with good manipulation and clear weather their
  messages can be followed by observers, with ordinary service telescopes,
  up to a distance of twelve miles or so. The poles are respectively five
  feet six inches long and three feet six inches, and the flags themselves
  are either white with a blue horizontal stripe across the centre, or
  wholly blue. Only one flag is used at a time, the first being used when
  the background is dark and the second when light, so as to ensure under
  all circumstances the greatest visibility.</p>

  <p>The person sending the signals should hold the flag pointing upwards
  to the left, and with the pole making an angle of about 25°, with an
  imaginary vertical line passing down the centre of his body. The signals
  are based upon the dot and dash system of Morse. The dot or short stroke
  is made by waving the flag from the normal position to the corresponding
  point on the right hand, while for the dash or long stroke the flag is
  waved till the head of the pole nearly touches the ground.</p>

  <p>The Morse alphabet is so constructed that the letters of most frequent
  occurrence are represented by the shortest symbols, and no letter
  requires more than four of these for its expression, while figures are
  all represented by five signs. <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum" title="139.png"
  ><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>

  <p>The letters of the alphabet are thus represented<span

  <p>A space about equal in length to the dash is left between each letter,
  and a time interval of about three times the duration between each word.
  This alphabet, once learned, it is evident can be utilized in many ways.
  Steamers, by means of short and long whistles, can spell out messages to
  each other; seamen, across a harbour, can communicate by waving their
  arms; prisoners by opening and shutting their hands. It is also utilised
  in the light-flashes of the heliograph, in telegraphy again, and in
  various other directions.</p>

  <p>Classes are held at the School of Army Signalling at Aldershot, and
  from thence the knowledge permeates the Army and the Auxiliary Forces.<a
  name="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> The requirements are
  steadiness, intelligence, quickness of eye-sight and of action, and the
  power to spell correctly; and it takes a man from fifteen to twenty days,
  at five hours drill a day, to learn the alphabet and the proper
  manipulation of the flags. The standard of efficiency is ten words a
  minute with the large flag or sixteen with the small. If our readers will
  take the trouble to count the letters in the first sixteen words in this
  present sentence they <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum" title="140.png"
  ><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>will find that they are sixty-nine in
  number, and they will further find, if they take the additional trouble
  to translate these letters into Morse, that it will take 105 dots and 60
  dashes to do it. Our readers will probably then go on to conclude that as
  it takes one hundred and sixty-five motions of the flag, plus sixty-eight
  intervals between the letters to signal these sixteen words, a speed of
  ten words a minute is a very creditable performance either for the sender
  to work off or for the receiver to read.</p>

  <p>Besides the ordinary spelling out of the words, various arbitrary
  signs are used, thus a continued succession of dots · · · · · · is used
  to call attention to the fact that a message is going to be sent, and a
  series of dashes &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; means
  that it is finished. G means "go on," R is a request to "move more to the
  right" and L to "shift a little to the left"; B means "use the blue
  flag," and W "use the white flag," K.Q is "say when you are ready," F.I
  means that figures are coming, and F.F indicates that the figures are
  finished. Those who have to receive the message may see that the
  background behind the transmitter is not quite satisfactory for the due
  observation of the flags, and they may then flash back H or O, meaning
  either "higher up" or "lower down," as the case may be, and in case of
  any misunderstanding, they will signal I.M.I, which means "please
  repeat," and as soon as all is clear, they will signal R.T, meaning "all
  right."</p>

  <p>As our man-of-war's-men are also instructed in this system of
  signalling, communication can be established during an expedition between
  the ships and the troops on shore. The signal for communication is a
  white pendant with two black X.X on it. Should this special flag not be
  forthcoming, the X.X &mdash; · · &mdash; &mdash; · · &mdash; (see code of
  letters) is flashed at night or waved by the flag by day, and as soon as
  the preparative dots · · · · · · have been acknowledged, the message is
  dispatched. When the message is of a general character, nothing more need
  be done, but when it is intended for a particular vessel, the
  communication is preceded by the special sign apportioned to that
  vessel.</p>

  <p>Though the Morse system has its place, as we have seen, in the drill
  of our blue-jackets, it does not altogether meet naval requirements. A
  man waving flags on board ship would be a scarcely conspicuous enough
  object, and intermediate vessels in a squadron would block out all view
  of him from those farthest off, hence naval communications are ordinarily
  made by means of flags exhibited from the mast head or other clearly
  visible position. Instead of one flag being used, our men-of-war have
  over forty, and these are all conspicuously distinct from each other. The
  messages are not spelt out, as in land operations, but the flags are used
  in various combinations, and the meaning of the signal is found by
  reference to a <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum" title="141.png"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>code-book. These flags, it is
  arithmetically evident, can be transposed and grouped in some thousands
  of different ways, and the code-book contains questions and answers to
  meet the very varied requirements of naval service, and the special
  signal hoist for each.</p>

  <p>The first real attempt at sea-signalling was made during the reign of
  Charles II., when a series of signs of the most arbitrary character was
  devised, consisting for the most part of flags hoisted in various parts
  of the ship, and altering their significance as their locality was
  changed. The system was a very cumbrous one, and in 1780 Kempenfeldt, the
  Commander of the ill-fated <i>Royal George</i>, improved to some extent
  upon it, but even then the result was not very brilliant. Lord Howe, in
  1792, could only make a total of one hundred and eighty-three signals. As
  yet, however, it had never struck anybody how much simplicity and
  advantage would be gained by employing numbered or lettered flags, and
  then using them in the thousands of combinations that such a system
  rendered possible. It is stated by various authorities&mdash;and even
  authorities have a way of copying from each other&mdash;that flags were
  numbered for the first time about the year 1799, but in the Library of
  the Royal United Service Institution may be seen "An Essay on Signals, by
  an Officer of the British Navy," bearing the date 1788.<a name="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> The flags were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
  6, 7, 8, 9, and 0, and they are represented in our illustrations by Figs.
  <a href="#fig287">287</a>, <a href="#fig288">288</a>, <a
  href="#fig289">289</a>, <a href="#fig290">290</a>, <a
  href="#fig291">291</a>, <a href="#fig292">292</a>, <a
  href="#fig293">293</a>, <a href="#fig294">294</a>, <a
  href="#fig295">295</a>, and <a href="#fig296">296</a>. It will be seen
  that they are all of a very clear and distinct character. When such a
  number as 444 was required, it would appear to be necessary to have three
  flags like Fig. <a href="#fig290">290</a>&mdash;the No. 4 of the
  series&mdash;but to avoid this multiplication of identical flags, a red
  triangular flag called a decimal, a white triangular called a centenary,
  and a blue triangular called a millenary, were used, and these were
  placed as required before the unit to be repeated. By this plan 444 would
  be expressed by the yellow flag, the No. 4, having below it the red and
  white pennants. Sometimes these flags really meant numbers, and then the
  required number was hoisted, plus a yellow swallow-tailed flag. Thus in
  answer to "How many guns does she carry?" if the response should be
  fifty, the five and the nought flags, Figs. <a href="#fig290">290</a> and
  <a href="#fig296">296</a>, plus the swallowtail or cornet, as it is
  technically called, would be hoisted, while the same five-nought signal,
  without the cornet, would signify "whole fleet change course four points
  to starboard."</p>

  <p>If we want to find the English equivalent of some German word, we turn
  to the German-English half of our dictionary, but if we <!-- Page 131
  --><span class="pagenum" title="142.png"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>required the German equivalent of our
  English word, we should refer to the English-German part of the book, and
  signal codes are in like manner divided into flag-message and
  message-flag. By the system we are at present discussing, we should find
  by referring to the flag-message half of our book, that the three flags
  7, 3, 6, meant, "recall cruisers," while 8, 3, 6, signified "sprung a
  leak." On the other hand, if we wished ourselves to send such an order we
  should turn to the message-flag half of our code book, and under the
  heading of "Cruisers," find all the references that could concern the
  management of such vessels until we presently found "Cruisers,
  recall&mdash;7, 3, 6," and then at once proceed to hoist those particular
  flags. Only fourteen flags, the ten numerals, the three pennants, and the
  cornet, suffice for sending many hundreds of messages, but the anonymous
  author adds, "exclusive of this arrangement, I would propose to have the
  most current signals in battle made with one flag only, and these should
  be used on the day of battle only. A similarity between these and the
  flags used as the numerical signals ought as much as possible to be
  avoided." Figs. <a href="#fig279">279</a>, <a href="#fig280">280</a>, <a
  href="#fig281">281</a>, <a href="#fig282">282</a>, <a
  href="#fig283">283</a>, <a href="#fig284">284</a>, <a
  href="#fig285">285</a>, and <a href="#fig286">286</a>, are illustrations
  of some of these. The striking design of the rising sun signifies "engage
  the enemy." Fig. <a href="#fig280">280</a> is an order for "close
  action." Fig. <a href="#fig281">281</a> is an instruction to "invert the
  line of battle by tacking," while Fig. <a href="#fig282">282</a> is a
  direction to "force the enemy's line." It is needless to particularise
  them all, suffice it to say that each and all are of stirring
  significance. Many minds were at work on the urgent problem of an
  adequate system of sea-signalling, and numerous plans, therefore, were
  suggested. It does not appear that the one we have just referred to as an
  example of these endeavours to solve the difficulty was ever adopted.</p>

  <p>The official "Signal Book for the Ships of War," compiled by the
  Admiralty in 1799, and afterwards amplified in 1803 by Admiral Sir Hope
  Popham, is of immense interest, as it was introduced into the Navy for
  the first time in the fleet of Nelson, and it was therefore the code of
  Trafalgar. In the copy preserved in the Library of the Royal United
  Service Museum is written, "this is a copy of the signal book by means of
  which the battle of Trafalgar was fought." All signals are by numbers. In
  the book in question, those given have been pasted over others, but some
  of those underneath are still visible: thus the flag that once
  represented one here stands for five, and the flag that heretofore was
  three is now seven. "If the Admiral"&mdash;an instruction in the book
  says&mdash;"should have reason to believe that the enemy has got
  possession of these signals, he will make the signal for changing the
  figures of the flags. The figure, which by the new arrangement each flag
  is to represent, is to be immediately entered in every ship's
  signal-book," and it is <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum" title="143.png"
  ><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>evident that one of these
  transpositions has been made here. The ten flags of the code are
  represented in Figs. <a href="#fig269">269</a>, <a
  href="#fig270">270</a>, <a href="#fig271">271</a>, <a
  href="#fig272">272</a>, <a href="#fig273">273</a>, <a
  href="#fig274">274</a>, <a href="#fig275">275</a>, <a
  href="#fig276">276</a>, <a href="#fig277">277</a>, and <a
  href="#fig278">278</a>. It is very difficult to say really how the flags
  were arranged for the world-famed "England expects that every man will do
  his duty," as the numerical significance of the ten flags was so often
  changed during the exigencies of war. The book we have referred to makes
  Fig. <a href="#fig270">270</a> stand for 1, Fig. <a
  href="#fig278">278</a> for 2, Fig. <a href="#fig275">275</a> for 3, Fig.
  <a href="#fig273">273</a> for 4, Fig. <a href="#fig269">269</a> for 5,
  etc.; and while it declares that it was by this code Trafalgar was
  fought, we have no evidence as to who wrote this statement. It may have
  been the authoritative statement of some one at the time in full
  possession of the facts, or a mere surmise added a dozen years afterwards
  by some irresponsible scribbler. On turning to the "Naval History" of
  James, Vol. IV., p. 34, we read "there is not, that we are aware of, a
  single publication which gives this message precisely as it was
  delivered. The following is a minute of the several flags, as noted down
  on board more than one ship in the fleet." He then proceeds to give them,
  and the arrangement that he follows is that of our illustration, his 1
  being Fig. <a href="#fig269">269</a>; 2, Fig. <a href="#fig270">270</a>;
  3, Fig. <a href="#fig271">271</a>; 4, Fig. <a href="#fig272">272</a>; 5,
  Fig. <a href="#fig273">273</a>; 6, Fig. <a href="#fig274">274</a>; 7,
  Fig. <a href="#fig275">275</a>; 8, Fig. <a href="#fig276">276</a>; 9,
  Fig. <a href="#fig277">277</a>; and 0 Fig. <a href="#fig278">278</a>. If
  he may be accepted as a reliable authority, "England" was expressed by
  the flags 2, 5, and 3; "expects," by 2, 6, and 9; "that," by flags 8, 6,
  and 3; "every," by flags 2, 6, and 1; "man," by 4, 7, and 1; "will," by
  9, 5, and 8; "do," by 2, 2 and 0; and "his," by 3, 7, 0, those being the
  code numbers assigned to those words in the vocabulary. This necessitated
  eight distinct hoists, one group of flags for each word, but singularly
  enough the code contained no signal for "duty," so that it was necessary
  to spell this out letter by letter, making four hoists more, flag 4 being
  for "d"; 2 and 1 for "u"; 1 and 9 for "t"; and 2 and 5 for "y." As given
  in one or two French historical works the signal is equally short and
  expressive: "L'Angleterre compte que chacun fera son devoir." The story
  of Nelson's signal is best told in the words of the <i>Victory's</i>
  Signal Lieutenant, Pasco, the officer who received Nelson's orders to
  make it. "His Lordship," Lieutenant Pasco says, "came to me on the poop,
  and, after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon,
  said, 'Mr. Pasco, I want to say to the fleet "England confides that every
  man will do his duty."' He added, 'You must be quick,<a name="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> for I have one more to add, which is
  for "close action."'<a name="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> I
  replied, 'If your Lordship will permit me to substitute "expects" for
  "confides" the signal will soon be <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum" title="144.png"
  ><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>completed, because the word "expects"
  is in the vocabulary, and "confides" must be spelt.'<a name="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> His Lordship replied in haste, and with
  seeming satisfaction, 'That will do, Pasco, make it directly.' As the
  last hoist was hauled down, Nelson turned to Captain Blackwood, who was
  standing by him, and said, 'Now I can do no more. We must trust to the
  Great Disposer of all events, and the justice of our cause; I thank God
  for this great opportunity of doing my duty.'" And Great Britain that day
  did not call upon her sons in vain, nor was the appeal to the God of
  Battles unheard, though the rejoicing of victory was turned into mourning
  at the loss of him who had so nobly done his duty in the nation's
  service.</p>

  <p>In the Royal Navy of the present day, a special code, requiring
  forty-five different flags, is employed. Figs. <a href="#fig254">254</a>
  to <a href="#fig267">267</a> inclusive, are examples of some of these.<a
  name="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> This code, we need
  scarcely say, is of a confidential nature, and is not published anywhere
  for all the world to study. The Commercial code of International signals
  being now recognised by the principal maritime States of the world, is,
  by Queen's regulations, made use of by our men-of-war when communicating
  with foreign war-ships, or with merchant vessels whether British or
  foreign. The signal codes of the Royal Navy, when not actually in use,
  are kept in perforated metal cylinders, so that in case of capture of the
  vessel they may at once be thrown overboard. In the Library of the Royal
  United Service Institution may be seen the Signal book of the U.S.
  frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>, with bullets attached to it for the purpose of
  sinking it. In the confusion incidental to the capture of the vessel by
  H.M.S. <i>Shannon</i>,<a name="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>
  it fell into the hands of the Britisher. Besides these regulation signals
  of the American Navy, a second set, supplied to privateers, was also
  captured, marked "Strictly confidential. The commanders of private armed
  vessels are to keep this paper connected with a piece of lead or other
  weight, and to throw the whole overboard before they shall strike their
  flag, that they may be sunk." This also, instead of going to the bottom
  of the Atlantic, may be seen within half a mile of Charing Cross.</p>

  <p>Landsmen have a notion, remembering possibly that Nelson went into
  action with the signal for close action flying, that when a signal is
  made it is to be instantly obeyed, but the present system of signalling
  is on somewhat different lines. The hoisting of a signal on the flag ship
  is preparative. The ships leading the other columns repeat the signal,
  hoisting their colours three-quarters of <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="145.png"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>the way
  up the mast. The other ships each hoist their "answering pennants" to
  show that they have seen and understood the order. Then when the
  repeating ships notice that all the other vessels have answered, they
  hoist the signal right up as an intimation to the Admiral that this is
  the case. Then it is that on the Admiral's ship the signal is hauled
  down, thus giving the executive order for its purport to be obeyed, so
  that the signal is cautionary of what is coming, and the man&oelig;uvre
  is only executed when to the eye no instructions at all are to be seen.
  The answering pennant has vertical stripes&mdash;red, white, red, white,
  red.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#fig268">268</a> is the flag used by any vessel that
  wishes to communicate with a coastguard station, or hoisted when one
  coastguard station wants to send a message to another. Thus when Beachy
  Head has any notification to make to the neighbouring post away down at
  Burling Gap, the first thing to be done is to hoist at the masthead Fig.
  <a href="#fig268">268</a>. When the men on duty at Burling Gap see this
  they hoist the answering pennant, meaning "all right, talk away," and
  then the arms of the Beachy Head semaphore work vigorously, or the gay
  signal flags flutter in the breeze and send their message across the
  downs.</p>

  <p>War vessels signal to each other at night by means of the Morse system
  of short and long flashes,<a name="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> and all the large steamship lines have
  night signals peculiar to themselves, thus the night signal of the Orient
  Line is red and blue lights burnt alternately. Any vessel seeing this,
  knows that they are dealing with this special Line and similarly report
  themselves, and after this due introduction proceed to dot and dash to
  their heart's content.</p>

  <p>The last two rows of flags on plate XXIII. are signals for pilots.
  These are either the two flags standing for P. and T. in the
  International Signal Code, a system we have yet to deal with, or it may
  be a single flag, the special pilot flag of each nation. Fig. <a
  href="#fig297">297</a> is the pilot flag of the Argentine Republic; Fig.
  <a href="#fig298">298</a>, that of Brazil; Fig. <a
  href="#fig299">299</a>, that of Ecuador. Fig. <a href="#fig300">300</a>
  is the pilot flag of Greece; 301, that of Japan; and 304, that of Spain.
  France, Mexico and Chili all adopt a flag like Fig. <a
  href="#fig278">278</a>, a white flag with broad blue border, while Great
  Britain, Fig. <a href="#fig104">104</a>, Germany, Fig. <a
  href="#fig302">302</a>, Belgium, Fig. <a href="#fig303">303</a>, Denmark,
  Fig. <a href="#fig305">305</a>, Holland, Fig. <a href="#fig306">306</a>,
  Sweden, Austria-Hungary, Italy, all fly the national flag of the country
  with a broad white border to it. Russia takes the Jack, Fig. <a
  href="#fig215">215</a>, for the same purpose, and places this <!-- Page
  135 --><span class="pagenum" title="146.png"><a
  name="page135"></a>{135}</span>white band around it, while the United
  States of America takes the star-bestrewn azure canton from the national
  flag, Fig. <a href="#fig146">146</a>, and similarly surrounds it with the
  broad band of white.</p>

  <p>Penalties are recoverable, as they clearly should be, if any ship uses
  or displays signals which may be mistaken for either pilot calls or
  signals of distress.</p>

  <p>The United States uses flags for its weather signals at the various
  meteorological stations. A violent storm is prognosticated by a red flag
  with a black centre. A red pennant signifies "storm approaching station,"
  while a yellow pennant signifies "call at station for special
  information." A plain white flag betokens fine weather and a plain blue
  one rain or snow, and there are various combinations of other flags that
  indicate direction, intensity, velocity and so forth. It is evident that
  this employment of flags could be made a very valuable one.</p>

  <p>Another instance of its use with which we are acquainted, is at the
  London office in St. Paul's Churchyard of the <i>Draper's Record</i>, one
  of the largest in circulation of any trade paper in the world. The
  citizen of London may see displayed from its roof by private enterprise
  the whole of the forecasts issued by the Meteorological Office, viz., the
  11 a.m., the 3.30 p.m., and the 8.30 p.m. for the South of England, which
  officially includes St. Paul's Churchyard. A white flag is hoisted for
  clear weather, a blue one for rain, while local showers are
  prognosticated by a flag half blue and half white. Changeable weather is
  indicated by a flag like Fig. <a href="#fig267">267</a>, and a coming fog
  by a yellow flag with black ball in its centre, like Fig. <a
  href="#fig258">258</a>. Snow is foretold by a flag like Fig. <a
  href="#fig278">278</a>, and squally weather by a swallow-tailed flag,
  having its upper half black, and the lower white. A plain red triangular
  flag is used to indicate temperature; when this is hoisted above other
  flags, it indicates rising temperature; when placed below, falling
  temperature; and when omitted we are to conclude that things are
  stationary. Thus the red flag, then below it the white one, and then the
  blue hoisted together, would mean that we might expect warmer weather, at
  first fair, but succeeded by rain, while the blue flag above the red
  would indicate that wet weather was before us, and a fall of
  temperature.</p>

  <p>At the 1894 meeting of the National Rifle Association at Bisley a
  system of this kind was inaugurated, in order to give those in camp an
  idea of the weather that might be expected for the ensuing twelve hours,
  the hoisting of a blue flag indicating fine weather or moderate wind, a
  red one foretelling stormy weather or strong wind; green, pointing to
  unsettled weather or gusty wind, and a yellow flag indicating thunder or
  rain storms. For shooting purposes a knowledge of the strength of the
  wind is very valuable. <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum" title="147.png"
  ><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span></p>

  <p>The development of a code of flag signals seems to have exercised a
  great fascination on many minds, and the result has been that until the
  general adoption of the International code things had got into a somewhat
  chaotic state. Some systems had many excellent points in them, while
  others broke down under the strain of practical use. In some cases, too,
  the claims of patriotism influenced the choice, it being difficult for an
  Englishman or an American to believe that the scheme of a Frenchman or
  German could possibly be better than the home-grown article.</p>

  <p>The systems best known in this country are the Admiralty codes of
  1808, 1816, and 1826, Lynn's in 1818, Squire's in 1820, Raper's in 1828,
  Philipps' in 1836, Eardley Wilmot's in 1851, the code of Rogers, the
  American, in 1854, the French code of Reynolds in 1855, and the system
  devised by Marryat in 1856, all being superseded by that of the Board of
  Trade.</p>

  <p>The International code of signals was prepared and first published in
  April, 1857, in accordance with the views and recommendations of a
  Committee appointed by the Lords of the Privy Council. Three members,
  Admiral Beechey, Captain Robert Fitzroy, and Mr. J. H. Brown, the
  Registrar-General of Seamen, were named by the Board of Trade; one
  member, Admiral Bethune, by the Admiralty; an elder brother, Captain Bax,
  was appointed as a member by the Trinity House; Mr. W. C. Hammett and
  Captain Halstead were the members named by Lloyds; while the Liverpool
  Shipowners' Association, and the General Shipowners' Society, each, by
  the nomination of a member, had a voice in the discussion.</p>

  <p>After a deliberation of more than a year, the examination of the
  thirteen then existing codes and due attention to any practical
  suggestion made to them, a mature and valuable scheme was promulgated.
  Eighteen flags in all, viz., one burgee, four pennants, and thirteen
  square flags, were employed, and these represented the consonants of the
  alphabet. These are depicted in the three upper rows on plate XXIV. Figs.
  <a href="#fig307">307</a> to <a href="#fig324">324</a>, the letter it
  stands for in the code being placed by each flag. These flags are
  combined in various ways, either in twos, threes, or fours, and are
  always read downwards, thus Fig. <a href="#fig325">325</a> must be read
  B.D.T.F; if we read it the reverse way, as F.T.D.B, it would have an
  entirely different significance.</p>

  <p>Of the two-flag signals we have three varieties. Should the burgee,
  Fig. <a href="#fig307">307</a>, be uppermost it constitutes what is
  termed an attention signal; thus the hoisting of B.D signifies, "What
  ship is that?" If the upper flag be a pennant C.D.F. or G it is a compass
  signal; thus G.F means west-north-west-half-west. If a square flag be
  uppermost it is an urgency signal; thus, N.C signifies "am in distress,"
  or N.J "am driving, no more anchors to let go." <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="148.png"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>Signals made with three flags are not classified according to the
  upper flag; they relate to subjects of general inquiry or communication
  of news. In the lower portion of Plate XXIV. we have given five examples
  of these. Fig. <a href="#fig330">330</a>, flags B.P.Q, asks "Do you wish
  to be reported?" while the hoisting of P.D.S, see Fig. <a
  href="#fig332">332</a>, replies, "Report me to Lloyds' Agent." Fig. <a
  href="#fig333">333</a>, H.V.F, asks, "Do you want assistance?" while Fig.
  <a href="#fig334">334</a>, G.B.H, enquires, "Has any accident happened?"
  Fig. <a href="#fig331">331</a>, made up of flags V.K.C, gives the
  reassuring answer to both enquiries&mdash;"All safe." As weather signals,
  we find "barometer rising" indicated by G.F.W; "barometer falling" by
  G.H.B; and "barometer standing," by G.H.C. Fine weather is prognosticated
  by the group H.M.S; a breeze off sea is foretold in the combination
  H.S.V; and a breeze off land by H.S.W.</p>

  <p>Signals composed of four flags are divided into different sections
  again, according to the form of the uppermost flag employed. If this
  upper flag be either of the pennants C.D or F, it indicates that the
  signal is what is called vocabulary. If the upper be the burgee&mdash;the
  letter B of the code&mdash;it is a geographical signal; thus, any vessel
  beating up channel and seeing Fig. <a href="#fig325">325</a>, made up of
  B.D.T.F, hoisted from a lighthouse, would, even if uncertain before, know
  their position, as this signal is the one specially assigned to the
  Eddystone. Fig. <a href="#fig326">326</a>, the letters B.D.P.Q, signifies
  that the vessel flying it hails from the port of London, while B.F.Q.T.
  is Edinburgh, and so on. All names of ships are expressed by four
  letters, thus N.V.B.Q is the code signal (Fig. <a href="#fig327">327</a>)
  of the steamship <i>Germanic</i>; M.N.D.L (Fig. <a
  href="#fig328">328</a>) that of the <i>Hesperus</i>; and Fig. <a
  href="#fig329">329</a>, made up of G.R.C.T, is the special grouping
  assigned to H.M.S. <i>Devastation</i>. All these names are recorded in
  the Shipping List, so that two vessels passing each other in mid-ocean
  are able at once to determine each others' names if within sighting
  distance of the flags run up. Should we see a stately liner coming to
  port, flying M.T.L.Q, we recognise that it is the <i>Australia</i> of the
  great Peninsula and Oriental Line, but if she runs up L.H.T.B then she is
  the Orient Company's boat <i>Orotava</i>. Some names occur frequently,
  thus other <i>Australias</i>, belonging to various owners, are
  distinguished by the code signals R.L.H.V, J.T.G.K, M.P.F.C, M.Q.N.G,
  M.T.W.D, W.F.T.N, etc., etc. Figs. <a href="#fig355">355</a>, <a
  href="#fig356">356</a>, <a href="#fig357">357</a>, <a
  href="#fig358">358</a>, <a href="#fig359">359</a> are all code signals of
  various <i>Australias</i>. While the Peninsular and Oriental Company has
  also a <i>Victoria</i>, K.M.Q.F., they have no monopoly of the name.
  There are numerous other boats of that popular designation, but even when
  vessels have the same name no two vessels ever have the same code letters
  assigned to them. Other <i>Victorias</i>, for example, are
  differentiated, as W.Q.M.N., L.S.H.R, K.P.G.Q, M.K.C.H, M.S.P.B, M.Q.C.J,
  L.D.F.H, T.R.B.N, K.J.H.P, T.D.R.F, etc., etc. Figs. <a
  href="#fig350">350</a>, <a href="#fig351">351</a>, <a
  href="#fig352">352</a>, <a href="#fig353">353</a>, <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="149.png"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span><a
  href="#fig354">354</a> are all <i>Victorias</i>; and Figs. <a
  href="#fig360">360</a>, <a href="#fig361">361</a>, <a
  href="#fig362">362</a>, <a href="#fig363">363</a>, <a
  href="#fig364">364</a> are the flag-signals of various <i>Britannias</i>.
  Our readers will see at once how distinctive they are. Figs. <a
  href="#fig335">335</a> to <a href="#fig349">349</a> inclusive are the
  special flags of well-known steamships of the Peninsular and Oriental,
  the Orient Line, and the <i>Compagnie Générale Transatlantique</i>.</p>

  <p>Should the vessel be a yacht, it is the <i>Aline</i> if she shows the
  flags P.W.N.D; the <i>Star of the Sea</i> if her signal is T.N.B.H; but
  if it is the <i>Meteor</i> we shall be aware of the fact from her
  hoisting the four flags L.C.T.P. The flag signal of the <i>Valkyrie</i>
  is L.F.M.G.</p>

  <p>Applications for the allotment of a code-signal, for the purpose of
  making ships' names known at sea, should be made, if of the United
  Kingdom, to the Registrar General of Shipping, Custom House, and, if
  belonging to a Colony, to the Registrar at the port to which the vessel
  belongs. If a ship to which this International Code Signal has been
  alloted is reported wrecked, lost, or sold to a foreigner, and her
  register is in consequence cancelled, the signal letters allotted to her
  are also cancelled, so that if the ship is afterwards recovered or
  re-purchased from foreigners, either in her original or some other name,
  new signal letters will be necessary, and the owner must make application
  anew for another allotment, as the signal letters the vessel originally
  bore may have been in the interval re-allotted.</p>

  <p>The flags to be hoisted at one time never exceed four, and it is an
  interesting arithmetical fact, that, with these eighteen flags, never
  using more than four at a time, over seventy-eight thousand different
  combinations can be made. With these flags, only using two at a time, 306
  different arrangements can be made, while by using three at a time we get
  4,896 possibilities, and by using four at a time, we can make 73,440
  changes; a total in all of 78,642 variations made from these simple
  elements. Marryat's code, prior to the introduction of the International,
  being the one most in use, twelve out of its sixteen flags were, to save
  expense, incorporated in the new code. Their significance was, however,
  entirely changed. Marryat's flags, too, were numerals, while the
  International code, as we have seen, has its flags named after the
  letters of the alphabet.</p>

  <p>Proposals are in the air to add eight new flags to the code, the X, Y,
  and Z, and the five vowels, since it is held that even the great number
  of combinations now possible may in time not suffice. The reason for the
  absence of the vowels is a somewhat curious one. Directly vowels are
  introduced we begin to spell words, and it was found that amongst the
  thousands of combinations possible, would be presently included all the
  profane, obscene, and otherwise objectionable four-letter words of the
  whole world. To hoist D.B.M.N could offend no one's susceptibilities, but
  to <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum" title="150.png"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span>run up the signal D.A.M.N in response to
  an enquiry is quite another matter, and it must be remembered that as
  this code is used by all civilised nations, a word that is merely
  meaningless in one country might be most offensive in another. An English
  Captain might hoist as a necessary signal J.A.L.P. or F.L.U.M. and see no
  possible objection to it, but "jalp" or "flum" might to the people of
  some other nationality carry a most atrocious significance.</p>

  <p>It is a practical necessity that all connected with the sea should
  understand the use of the International code, therefore, the Lords
  Commissioners of the Admiralty require that all Royal Naval Reserve men
  who act as Masters or Mates of ships should be instructed in its working,
  and the Board of Trade makes like requirements from all candidates for
  Masters' or Mates' Certificates. Its International character is a most
  valuable feature, as by its use two captains, say a Dane and a Greek, or
  a Russian and a Spaniard, who, on the quay, could not comprehend a word
  of each other's language, can at sea, by this common flag-language, come
  to a perfectly clear understanding of each other's need, or impart any
  information required. It is the only code used at the signal stations
  around our coasts. Lloyds' have thirty-three of these signal stations at
  Dover, Beachy Head, Lundy Island, Dungeness, Flamborough Head, St.
  Catherine's Point, North Foreland, and other conspicuous points on our
  line of ocean traffic, and abroad again at Aden, Ascension, Gibraltar,
  Bermuda, Honolulu, Suez, Perim, Malta, Teneriffe, and elsewhere, and here
  too, the International is the only code recognised.</p>

  <p>This "Lloyds," that we may see daily referred to in the newspapers, is
  a Corporation that, amongst other marine business, distributes shipping
  intelligence. A Mr. Edward Lloyd, in the seventeenth century, kept a
  coffee house in Tower Street, which in time from the daily gathering
  there of merchants, captains, and others interested in marine affairs,
  became a centre for shipping and underwriting news and business. In the
  year 1692 it was moved to Lombard Street, and in 1774 the coffee
  supplying part of the business was abandoned and rooms were taken in the
  Royal Exchange. During the wars with Napoleon, the Government was often
  indebted to the Committee of Lloyds' for the earliest information of
  important events all over the world. Lloyds' has its agents in every
  port, and by its complete organisation and the potent aid of the
  telegraph, the shipping business of the world is brought day by day
  before us. Vessels spoken far out on the ocean are reported by the vessel
  that spoke them immediately on its arrival at any port. Thus a
  sailing-vessel journeying from London to Vancouver may be five months or
  more before it touches land, <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum" title="151.png"
  ><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>but during that time it is sighted by
  other vessels from time to time, and these report having seen it, and
  that all was well on board. So the mother knows that her son, who is
  parted from her by thousands of miles of ocean, has got thus far in
  health and safety; and the owners of the vessel learn that their venture
  has so far surmounted the perils of Cape Horn and the other dangers of
  the deep. The good ship is drawing nearer at each report to the end of
  her long voyage, and on arrival at last off Vancouver, as the land is
  sighted, the signal flags run up once more to the masthead, the news of
  her coming is flashed across continent and ocean, and the London
  newspaper of the next morning contains the brief notification that far
  exceeds to anxious hearts all else of interest its broad pages may
  contain.</p>

  <p>Familiarity, though it may not necessarily breed contempt, dulls the
  sense of the wonder of it all, and yet how marvellous it is! We have
  before us the <i>Standard</i>, that came into our hands about seven
  o'clock this morning, and we find from it that yesterday the
  <i>Glenshiel</i> had arrived at Hong Kong, that the <i>Arab</i>, from
  Cape Town, had just put in at Lisbon, that the <i>Sardinian</i>, from
  Quebec, had reached Moville, that the <i>Circassian</i> was safely at New
  York, that the <i>Orizaba</i>, speeding on to Sydney, had at 2 a.m.
  passed the desolate shores of arid Perim, that the <i>Danube</i>, from
  Southampton, had at 6 a.m. entered the harbour of Rio Janeiro. Of this,
  and much else of the same tenor, may we read in a space of a
  quarter-column or so of the paper as we sit at breakfast and see pass
  before us a panorama of world-wide interest and extent; and to accomplish
  this result, the flags we have figured have been a potent factor.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Though we have covered much ground, it must have been patent to all
  readers who have thus far companioned us that much detail was necessarily
  omitted, unless our book had to grow to the dimensions of an
  encyclopædia. It would probably, for instance, take some fifty figures or
  so to give all the distinctive flags of the various government
  departments, official ranks, etc., of a single Great Power. We trust
  nevertheless that while our labours have been by no means exhaustive,
  they have been instrumental in showing that there is much of interest in
  flag-lore, and that an increased knowledge and appreciation of our
  subject may be one result of our pleasant labours, and prove full
  justification for our work.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> "Every Isle differs from each
  other in their Fancy of making Plads, as to the Stripes in Breadth and
  Colours. This Humour is as different through the main Land of the
  Highlands in so far that they who have seen those Places are able at the
  first View of a man's Plad to guess the Place of his
  Residence."&mdash;Martin's "Description of the Western Islands," 1703.
  See also "Old and Rare Scottish Tartans," by Donald Stewart, all
  illustrated by actual pieces woven in silk to a reduced scale. The latest
  tartan, that of Balmoral, was devised by Prince Albert in the year
  1848.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> In mediæval days the pastoral
  staff or crook of the bishop often had a small scarf attached to it. This
  was known as the vexillum, and was supposed to be derived from the
  Labarum, or standard of the first Christian emperor, Constantine the
  Great.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> In Favyn's book, "Le Théâtre
  d'honneur et de Chevalerie," published in Paris some two hundred and
  fifty years ago, we read of "Le grand estendard de satin bleu celeste
  double en riche broderie de fleurs de lys d'or de Chypre à une grande
  croix plein de satin blanc, qui est la croix de France.</p>

  <p>"Le grand estendard Saint Michel ange gardien de la France, de satin
  bleu celeste de riche broderie d'or de Chypre, semé d'estoiles d'or.</p>

  <p>"Le grand estendard de l'ordre du benoist Saint-Esprit, faict de
  double satin verd à une columbe d'argent, rayonné d'or de riche broderie,
  le rest semé de flammes d'or."</p>

  <p>Joan of Arc had a white standard powdered over with gold
  fleurs-de-lys, and in the centre a figure of Christ sitting on a rainbow,
  and holding a globe. On either side an angel in the posture of adoration,
  and, underneath, the words "Jhesu, Maria." On another she had the
  Annunciation, and the words "Ave Maria." These were painted at Tours "par
  James Power, Ecossais, Peintre du Roi."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> Thus the Cross of St. George
  would be normally represented as in Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a>, but we
  find it much elongated in Figs. <a href="#fig12">12</a> and <a
  href="#fig14">14</a>, much widened out in Figs <a href="#fig27">27</a>
  and <a href="#fig56">56</a>, and yet more so on the shield of the arms of
  the Dominion of Canada in Fig. <a href="#fig129">129</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> We do not pause to explain the
  meaning of any heraldic terms that we are obliged to employ. Such terms
  may be readily found in any technical book on blazonry, and we have
  ourselves, in "The History, Principles and Practice of Heraldry," gone
  very thoroughly into the meaning and use of the various forms that enter
  into the blazonry of shield or banner, and do not, therefore, repeat
  these matters here.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> The modern flag, known as the
  burgee, largely used in flag signalling, is like a shortened pennon. It
  is sometimes also called a cornet.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> "Now the often changing
  fortune beganne also to channge the law of the battels. For at the first,
  though it were terrible, yet Terror was deckt and broachie with rich
  furniture, guilt swords, shining armours, pleasant pensils, that the eye
  with delight had scarce time to be afraide; but now all defiled with
  dust, blood, broken armour, mangled bodies, tooke away the maske, and set
  forth Horror in his own horrible manner."&mdash;<span class="sc">Sir

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> "A streamer shall stand in the

  forty, or sixty yards."&mdash;Harleian MS., No. 2,358, dealing with "the
  Syze of Banners, Standardes, Pennons, Guydhomes, Pencels, and
  Streamers."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> While thus severe in our
  judgment on misguided foreigners it is only just to point out that
  England itself is responsible for a combination as horrible as any in the
  green, red, white, of the special flag that she bestowed on Heligoland,
  while it was yet a British possession. It may be seen in Fig. <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> The famous banner of the
  Knights Templars, called the Beau-seant, had its upper half black and
  lower white. The black symbolised the terror it should be to the foe, and
  the white amity and goodwill to friends.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_16" href="#NtA_16">[16]</a> The "house-flags" of the
  various shipping companies make a great use of letters: thus the flag of
  the Orient Steam Navigation Company is white and divided into four
  portions by a blue cross. In these four portions are placed in red the
  letters O.S.N.C. In Fig. <a href="#fig120">120</a> we have the flag of
  the New Zealand Shipping Company, where the N.Z.S. Co. are equally
  conspicuous. Any reference to a good list of house-flags, such as that
  published by Griffin, would reveal scores of illustrations of this
  feature.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> The map is freely embellished
  with illustrations. In South America, for instance four immense crimson
  parrots about fill up Brazil, while in Africa the parrots are green. Many
  of these figured details are very quaint.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_19" href="#NtA_19">[19]</a> With only one exception the
  Sovereigns of Scotland never quartered the arms of any other kingdom with
  their own. The only exception was when Mary Stuart claimed the arms of
  England and placed them upon her standard, and thus gave irreparable
  provocation to Queen Elizabeth.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> Brian Boru, who was killed in
  battle with the Danes, did much to civilise Ireland; and, amongst other
  things, introduced the harp. The ancient Irish harp at Trinity College,
  Dublin, was long claimed as the identical instrument of Boru, but it has
  been proved by the ornament upon it that it cannot be later than the
  fourteenth century. The most primitive representation of the harp in
  Ireland is in a rude sculpture in a church near Kilkeny. This is known to
  date from the ninth century. Though the harp has ever shone in the poetry
  of the Irish people, they have but little claim to it. It has been by no
  means such a national instrument with the Irish as with the Welsh. It is
  one of the most ancient of instruments, figuring in the mural paintings
  of Egypt centuries before the Christian era.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21" href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> As may be seen beautifully
  enamelled on his tomb in Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> Another flag was a plain
  scarlet one, having this inscription: "For the Protestant Religion and
  the Liberty of England" in white upon it.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_23" href="#NtA_23">[23]</a> The following summary may be
  taken as correct in its broad facts:&mdash;From about 1195 to 1340, the
  Standard had the lions of England alone on it. From 1340 to 1377, England
  and France together. 1377 to 1399, England, France, and the arms of
  Edward the Confessor. 1399 to 1603, England and France. 1603 to 1649,
  England, France, Scotland and Ireland. 1649 to 1659, Interregnum: a
  period of change and uncertainty, when divers changes in the Standard
  were made that are scarcely worth detailing. 1659 to 1688, England,
  France, Scotland, and Ireland. 1688 to 1701, England, France, Scotland,
  Ireland, and Nassau. 1701 to 1714, England, France, Scotland, and
  Ireland. 1714 to 1801, England, France, Scotland, Ireland, and Hanover.

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> One interesting exception to
  this is that, on St. George's Day, the 5th regiment (Northumberland
  Fusiliers) holds full-dress parade, all wearing the rose, the national
  emblem, in their headgear, and the officers on their sword-knots also.
  The colours, too, are festooned with roses.</p>

  blue, the white and orange, the green and red, the purple, the blue and
  white, the orange and green, the red and yellow, the red and blue, the
  red and white, and divers others. The orange company always took the
  lead. These companies were for a long time in abeyance, and were
  superseded in 1798 by the formation of the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers,
  but each year the Magistrates and Council still appoint one of their
  number to be captain of the orange colours. His duty is to take charge of
  the old colours and preserve them as an interesting relic of a bygone
  institution.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> It is remarkable that none of
  the flags extant bear the motto which the Parliament on July 5th, 1650,
  ordered "to be upoun haill culloris and standardis," <i>i.e.</i>, "For
  Covenant, Religion, King, and Kingdom." It is characteristic that each
  body claimed independence even in this matter. Thus the Fenwick flag bore
  "Phinegh for God, Country, and Covenanted work of Reformations." Another
  flag has, "For Reformation in Church and State, according to the Word of
  God and our Covenant," while yet another bears the inscription, "For
  Christ and His truths, no quarters to ye active enemies of ye
  Covenant."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> The question of the Union
  between England and Scotland was often mooted. In the year 1291 Edward
  I., being victorious in the north, declared the two countries united, but
  this did not last long. In 1363 Edward III. opened negotiations for a
  union of the two crowns if King David of Scotland died without issue. In
  the reign of Edward VI. the matter was again to the fore, but it was left
  to Queen Elizabeth to take the decisive step.</p>

  Holland, the ship has a large red flag charged with the Stuart arms in

  reverted to the royal standard of his Stuart predecessors and to the
  original form of the union flag, a form that during the Protectorate was
  widely departed from.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_40" href="#NtA_40">[40]</a> A writer in the
  <i>Retrospective Review</i> in the year 1847, thus relieves his
  feelings:&mdash;"The banner of St. George, argent, and cross gules is
  still borne as part of the English flag, though, from the disgraceful
  manner in which it has been amalgamated with the Crosses of St. Andrew
  and St. Patrick, it has not only lost all its purity, but presents a
  melancholy example of the ignorance of heraldry and total want of
  patriotism and taste which must have characterised those to whom we
  unfortunately owe its arrangement."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_41" href="#NtA_41">[41]</a> "All Her Majesty's Ships of

  <p><a name="Nt_42" href="#NtA_42">[42]</a> We read, for instance, in the
  Diary of Pepys that in the expedition of the Duke of Buckingham, in the
  year 1627, against the Isle de Rhé that "the Duke divided his fleet into
  squadrons. Himself, ye Admirall, and General in chiefe, went in ye
  Triumphe, bearing the Standard of England in ye maine topp, and Admirall
  particular of the bloody colours. The Earl of Lindsay was Vice-Admirall
  to the Fleete in the Rainbowe, bearing the King's usual colours in his

  colours. The Lord Harvey was Rear Admirall in ye Repulse, bearing the

  Regiments with blue facings are the 1st, 4th, 6th, 7th, 13th, 18th, 21st,
  23rd, 25th, etc., while buff is found in the 2nd, 3rd, 14th, 22nd, 27th,
  31st, 40th, etc. Amongst the regiments with yellow facings are the 9th,
  10th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 20th, 26th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 34th, 37th, 38th,
  etc. White is met with in the 17th, 32nd, 41st, 43rd, 47th, 59th, 65th.
  Red is not so common, since the colour is that of the tunic ordinarily,
  but we see it in the 33rd, 48th, and 76th. Black is also less commonly
  used, but we find it in the facings of the 58th, 64th, 70th, and 89th
  Regiments.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_46" href="#NtA_46">[46]</a> The "Black Watch," the gallant

  British troops.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_47" href="#NtA_47">[47]</a> When a regiment consists of

  <p><a name="Nt_48" href="#NtA_48">[48]</a> In like manner we find the
  Royal Marines bearing on their colours an anchor, first granted to the
  corps as a badge in the year 1775. The lion and crown was added to this
  in 1795. In 1802, in honour of the gallant share taken by the Marines in
  the capture of Bellisle, a laurel wreath was added to the other badges of
  honour, and in 1827 the motto "<i>Per Mare per Terram</i>" and a globe,
  surmounted by the word "Gibraltar," was also placed on their colours, as
  a testimony to the services of the Marines all over the world, and
  notably at the taking of Gibraltar.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_50" href="#NtA_50">[50]</a> This, with many other
  interesting trophies of war, may be seen in the Chapel of Chelsea
  College. The Blenheim Colours are now nearly all consumed away with age:
  of one but the staff remains, and many others are now as tender as
  tinder. French, Russian, American, Chinese, and many other flags of
  former foes may there be seen quietly fading away, as the old national
  animosities have likewise done.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_51" href="#NtA_51">[51]</a> Amongst the various devices
  seen on the flags of the Parliamentarians, was one of a skull surrounded
  by a laurel crown, accompanied by the words "<i>Mors vel

  <p><a name="Nt_52" href="#NtA_52">[52]</a> There are the colours of other
  regiments as well. Those that we specially refer to above will be found
  in what is known as the Warriors' Chapel. We deal with these especially,
  because, as being the flags of the territorial regiment, they find, with
  particular appropriateness, their resting place in Canterbury
  Cathedral.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_53" href="#NtA_53">[53]</a> There is now no Lord High
  Admiral of Great Britain; his functions are analogous to those of the
  Commander-in-Chief of the Army; the last Lord High Admiral was William
  IV., who received this appointment when Prince of Wales. The office is
  now said to be "in commission"&mdash;its functions are performed by the
  Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a board uniting the dual control
  which is exercised over the land Forces by the War Office and the Horse
  Guards. Commissions of Naval Officers are not signed by the Queen, they
  are headed "By the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High
  Admiral of the United Kingdom," etc.; and they are signed by two of the
  Lords.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_54" href="#NtA_54">[54]</a> We find the Royal Yacht Club,
  in 1815, and the Royal Thames Yacht Club, in 1835, flying what would be a
  white ensign if it had but the great Cross of St. George upon it; an
  entirely white flag having the Union in the corner next the staff. One
  may get a fair notion of its effect by looking at Fig. <a
  href="#fig154">154</a>, but imagining the Union in the place of the
  device there seen. The Royal Yacht Club burgee at this period was plain
  white, without any device whatever. The burgee of the other Club we have
  named has undergone many changes. In 1823 it is scarlet, with the letters
  T.Y.C. in white; in 1831 the prefix Royal has been gained, and the flag,
  still red, has the crown and the R.T.Y.C. in white upon it; while in 1834
  we still find the crown and the same letters, but now, not white on red,
  but red on white.</p>

  the accoutrements of many of the regiments, enwreathing the motto or
  device; sometimes alone, and often in association with the rose, thistle,
  and shamrock.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_57" href="#NtA_57">[57]</a> Thus in a French book on flags
  (La Haye's), published in 1737, we see a "pavillon de Nouvelle Angleterre
  en Amerique." This is a blue flag, having on a white canton the Cross of
  St. George, and in the first quarter of this canton a globe, in allusion
  to America, the new world.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_58" href="#NtA_58">[58]</a> In September, 1775, Moultrie,
  the heroic defender of the fort which still bears his name, devised this
  the first flag of the State of South Carolina, the uniform of the South
  Carolina men being blue, and some of the regiments having a silver
  crescent in their caps; but why they had the silver crescent as a badge
  no record seems to inform us.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_59" href="#NtA_59">[59]</a> It may be somewhat of an
  assistance to our readers if we give a few chronological details: The
  obnoxious duty on tea and other articles imposed by the British
  Parliament, June, 1767. Tea thrown overboard in Boston harbour by the
  discontented populace, November, 1773. The Boston Port Bill, by which
  that port was to be shut up until compensation made to the East India
  Company for the tea destroyed, passed March, 1774. General Congress of
  the colonists at Philadelphia, September, 1774. Revolution, first blood
  shed at Lexington, April, 1775. Washington appointed Commander-in-Chief
  of the American Armies, June, 1775. Thirteen colonies declare themselves
  independent, July 4th, 1776. Independence of Colonies recognised by
  France in March, 1778, by Holland in April, 1782, and by Great Britain in
  September, 1783. John Adams received as ambassador from America by George
  III. in June, 1785, and first ambassador sent from Great Britain to the
  United States, in 1791.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_60" href="#NtA_60">[60]</a> In an old print before us of
  the fight between the <i>Shannon</i> and the <i>Chesapeake</i>, we see
  that the latter hoists three American flags, all having the top and

  enigmatical motto, "Free Trade and Sailors' rights."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_62" href="#NtA_62">[62]</a> At a banquet at the Mansion
  House, when many leading Englishmen and eminent Colonists gathered
  together to celebrate St. George's Day, the American Ambassador, an
  honoured guest, said that he was very conscious that he was there at a
  gathering of the clans. "There was a tradition that the mischievous boy
  was generally the favourite of the household. His mother might confess it
  openly, his father secretly, but the rest of the family said nothing
  about it. Now there was a mischievous boy who broke away from home
  something more than a century ago, but let them not suppose that because
  he left the home he or his descendants ever came back without a strong
  feeling that it is the home." He went on to say that he never met a body
  of representative Englishmen, British men, speaking the same language
  that he did, without a sense of grave joy and pleasure: the sense that
  they were his brethren in a great cause, and that he joined with them, he
  and his people, in sustaining the best hopes and aspirations of the
  world's civilization. Blood is thicker than water, and all right-minded
  Englishmen will read his kindly words with pleasure, and give them
  heartiest reciprocation.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_63" href="#NtA_63">[63]</a> To the Germans, in their
  campaign against France, this and the "Watch upon the Rhine" were worth
  many battalions as a spur and stimulus to heroic deeds. During the
  American War both Federals and Confederates owed much to the influence of
  stirring patriotic songs. There can be no doubt that the songs of Dibdin
  contributed not a little to our own naval victories, and every cause that
  is worth fighting for evokes like stirring strains. Perhaps one of the
  most marked illustrations of this is the birth of that grand war-song
  known as the "Marseillaise." Rouget de l'Isle, its author, was a captain
  of French Engineers stationed in Strassbourg on the opening of the
  campaign against Austria and Prussia in 1792. On the eve of the day that
  the contingent from that city was going to join the main army of the
  Rhine, a question arose as to what air should be played at their
  departure. Several were suggested and rejected, and Rouget de l'Isle left
  the meeting and retired to his own quarters, and before the gathering
  broke up had written both words and music of "Le Chant de l'Armee du
  Rhin." On returning to the meeting, still in consultation on the various
  details of the morrow, he sang his composition, and it was at once
  welcomed with delight. It flew like wildfire throughout France, and,
  owing to the Marseillaise troops singing it on entering Paris, it derived
  the name by which it has ever since been known. Its stirring words and
  the grand roll of the music aroused the enthusiasm of the country, and at
  once made it the battle-song of France, to be at times proscribed, but
  never forgotten.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_64" href="#NtA_64">[64]</a> The book on German costume by
  Köbel, printed at Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1545, should be referred to,
  if possible, by the reader. It is, unfortunately, a very rare book. The
  first edition of this splendid volume contains 144 large illustrations of
  standard-bearers; the figures are admirably drawn and very varied in
  attitude, while the flags they carry are replete with interest, many of
  course being now quite obsolete, while others there represented have come
  down to us through the three centuries intact.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_65" href="#NtA_65">[65]</a> The <i>Pamiot Azof</i>, one of
  the most powerful ironclads of the Russian Navy, flies at her mast-head
  the Cross of St. George (white on red), in memory of the gallant service
  at Navarino in 1527 of her predecessor of that name. The Czar Nicholas
  decreed that all future <i>Pamiot Azofs</i> in the navy should bear this
  distinguishing mark of honour. Peter the Great built the first <i>Pamiot
  Azof</i> as a memorial of the great siege of Azof, and the name has been
  handed down ever since. The influence of that piece of scarlet and white
  bunting will doubtless be such that no <i>Pamiot Azof</i> will ever fall
  short of the highest expectations that this exceptional honour would
  suggest.</p>

  eagle, adopted by the Emperor Napoleon at the commencement of this
  century, was a brilliant symbol of the grandeur of France. It disappeared
  amongst our calamities. It ought to return when France, raised up again,
  should no more repudiate her high position. Soldiers! Take again the
  eagles which have so often led our fathers to glory." In 1855, in
  addressing a detachment of the Imperial Guard prior to its departure for
  the Crimea, he exclaimed, "The Imperial Guard, the heroic representative
  of military glory and honour, is here before me. Receive then these
  eagles, which will lead you on to glory. Soon will you have planted them
  on the walls of Sebastopol!"</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_73" href="#NtA_73">[73]</a> The diary of Henry Machyn,
  "Citizen and Merchant Tayler of London," from which we have already
  quoted, tells us how the writer saw the "Kyng's grace and dyvers
  Spaneards," the said King being Philip of Spain, riding through the city
  attired in red and yellow, the colours of Spain. In the cavalcade, Machyn
  tells us, were "men with thrumpets in the same colors, and drumes made of
  ketylles, and baners in the same colors."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_75" href="#NtA_75">[75]</a> The following chronological
  items may prove of assistance. Crown of Navarre passes to France, 1276.
  Ferdinand of Arragon re-conquers Navarre, 1512. Accession of House of
  Austria to throne of Spain, 1516. Spain annexed Netherlands, 1556, and,
  shortly after Philip II., husband of our Queen Mary, annexed Burgundy.
  Portugal united to Spain, 1580. Portugal lost, 1640. Philip V. invades
  Naples, 1714. Charles III., King of the Two Sicilies, succeeds to Spanish
  crown, 1759.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_76" href="#NtA_76">[76]</a> The various heralds and
  pursuivants in their tabards blazoned with the lions of England, the
  fleurs-de-lys of France, or the castles of Portugal.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_77" href="#NtA_77">[77]</a> Az. three crosses in pale
  or.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_78" href="#NtA_78">[78]</a> The Turks, originally an
  Asiatic people, overran the provinces of the Eastern, or Greek Empire,
  about the year 1300, but did not capture Constantinople until 1453.
  Thirty years afterwards they obtained a footing in Italy, and in 1516
  Egypt was added to the Empire. The invading hosts spread terror
  throughout Europe, and in 1529 and in 1683 we find them besieging Vienna.
  Rhodes was captured from the Knights of St. John, Greece subdued, Cyprus
  taken from the Venetians: but later on the tide of war turned against
  them, and frequent hostilities with England, France, and Russia led to
  the gradual weakening of the Turkish power.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_79" href="#NtA_79">[79]</a> There is such a general
  impression that officials are so very much bound up in highly-starched
  red tape that we gladly take this opportunity of acknowledging the
  extreme consideration with which all our enquiries have been met. The
  libraries of the Admiralty, the Royal United Service Museum, the
  Guildhall, South Kensington, etc., have been placed unreservedly at our
  service. The authorities of the Board of Trade, of Lloyds, of the Royal
  Chelsea Hospital, of the Royal Naval Exhibition, the Agents-General of
  the Colonies, have all most willingly given every possible information,
  and we have received from all to whom we have applied for information the
  greatest readiness to afford it, and the most courteous responses.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_80" href="#NtA_80">[80]</a> The position of Sultan, though
  one of great dignity, has its serious drawbacks. This all-conquering
  Murad was, after all, assassinated; his son and successor, Bajuzet, died
  in prison. Isa Belis the next holder of the throne, Solyman who succeeded
  him, and Musa, who succeeded Solyman, were all in turn murdered by their
  brothers or other relatives.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_81" href="#NtA_81">[81]</a> "Order and progress." Not a
  very happily chosen motto, since, as a Brazilian said to us, such a
  sentiment might equally be placed on the flags of all civilized nations,
  order and progress not being features to take any special credit for, but
  to be entirely taken for granted, and as a matter of course.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_82" href="#NtA_82">[82]</a> Our English name, Japan, for
  this land of the Far East, is a corruption of the Chinese name for it,
  <i>Zipangn</i>, a word of the same meaning, Land of the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_83" href="#NtA_83">[83]</a> There are four Orders of
  Distinction in Japan; the first is the Order of the Chrysanthemum, and
  the second that of the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_84" href="#NtA_84">[84]</a> Each spring and summer our
  Volunteers have long-distance practices. From the account of one of these
  now before us, we see that the line extended from Reculvers on the north
  coast of Kent, to Aldershot, a distance of over one hundred miles,
  messages from one point to the other being rapidly and accurately
  transmitted by signalling parties on the various eminences, such as
  Beacon Hill, Gravelly Hill, Box Hill, and St. Martha's Hill, between the
  two extremities of the line.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_85" href="#NtA_85">[85]</a> One may see here, too, the
  signal book of James, Duke of York, dating about 1665, by means of which
  most of our sea-fights with the Dutch were conducted, and also the code
  introduced by Kempenfeldt.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_86" href="#NtA_86">[86]</a> The <i>Victory</i> at this
  time was somewhat less than a mile and a half from the enemy's line.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_87" href="#NtA_87">[87]</a> The signal for "close action"
  was flags 1 and 6. All flag signals are always read from above downwards;
  6 and 1 would mean something entirely different to 1 and 6.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_88" href="#NtA_88">[88]</a> "Expects," it will be seen, is
  expressed by one hoist of flags, while "confides" would have necessitated
  the pulling up and hauling down of eight distinct sets.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_89" href="#NtA_89">[89]</a> Special hoists are also used
  for special purposes, thus the display of the yellow flag, with a black
  ball on it, is an intimation that torpedo practice is going on.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_90" href="#NtA_90">[90]</a> June 1st, 1813.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_91" href="#NtA_91">[91]</a> This system was introduced by
  Captain Columb in 1862. On one occasion, during heavy weather, from a
  steamer fifteen miles off shore he sent a message through a station on
  the Isle of Wight across to Portsmouth, and received his answer back in
  thirteen minutes! This was altogether too good to be gainsaid or shelved,
  and the system was speedily adopted.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
